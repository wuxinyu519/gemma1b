We have two industries, B2B SaaS and Ecommerce. Within SaaS, we are used by customer success teams.

This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights & actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

We have two industries, B2B SaaS and Ecommerce. Within SaaS, we are used by customer success teams. Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. \n\nTogether with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights & actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

{"prompt": "Overview\n========================\n\n\\_A sandbox to test units against each other\\_\n\nThis scene is for testing the design of RTS units. Units can be assembled from prefabs of parts. Components for sensors and behaviours can be added. Part categories include weapons (such as lasers and missiles) and movement systems (like wheels, treads, or propellers).\n\nGame designers will create unit designs from the parts and components, and then place armies of these units in the scene. Units assigned to different teams will fight each other. The game designers will use this to test out new ideas for unit parts and to balance the units.\n\nEventually we'd like to release a game that combines the factory automation and RTS genres and allows players to assemble custom unit designs from parts, using conveyor belts and assemblers.\n\nFile descriptions\n========================\n\n## Behaviours\n\\* UnitBehaviour.cs - Base class for behaviours. Units can have multiple behaviours. Behaviours can be ordered in the editor and they will run in this order. Later behaviours can override actions from earlier behaviours.\n\\* SeekAndDestroy.cs - This behaviour causes a unit to patrol the area for enemies and attack any enemies found on sight.\n\\* Flee.cs - Makes the unit flee from battle. You can set it to only flee when low on health.\n\n## Parts\n\\* UnitPart.cs - Base class for parts. Currently has `weight` and provides a reference to the Unit for convenience. Will probably handle sockets as well.\n\\* Armor.cs - you can add this component to any part or unit. It will give the unit more hit points.\n\\* BasicGun.cs - A gun component. Add as part of a gun prefab to make it shoot. You can set properties of the gun such as the damage, cooldown and range.\n\\* BasicMovement.cs - A movement component. Parts with this component allow the unit to move. You can set properties such as the acceleration, top speed, turning radius, etc.\n\n## Sensors\n\\* Vision.cs - A component that lets the unit detect other units. It sees in a cone in front of the unit.\n\n## Designs\n\\* Peewee - A basic infantry unit with a gun.\n\\* Turret - A stationary, defensive unit with two cannons.\n\n## Other files\n\\* UnitManager.cs\n\\* Unit.cs\n\\* HealthBar.cs\n\n## Interfaces\n\\* IPosition - Anything that has a position. It contains a `Vector3 Position { get; }` property.\n\\* ITargetable - An interface for things that can be targeted, such as units, buildings, or even locations on the map.\n\\* IWeapon - An interface for weapons, such as BasicGun. You can call `SetTarget(ITargetable target)` to set a target for the weapon.

{"prompt": "Can you help me with a job interview I have tomorrow? \n I'll give you the the transcript of an Interview to the company CEO André. He is having a conversation with Florian, the interviewer.\n\nCan you extrapolate what does Andrè appreciate in people, and how to best approach him, based on the content of this interview?\n\nTranscript:\nWe want to build a service that is predictable and that is accessible 24/7.\nAnd welcome to SlatorPod. Today we are really happy to have André Bastié on the Pod.\nSo André is the co-founder and CEO of Happy Scribe an all in one transcription, subtitling platform.\nHi, André. Hey, Florian. So where does this podcast find you today? What country?\nWhat city? Thank you first for welcoming me today, so I am based in Barcelona in Spain.\nI've been living here for around three years now and yeah. There you go, you got a Paris map for those who see, who watch it on YouTube.\nWe got a Paris map in the back and you have some Ireland connection, as far as I remember, so yeah.\nNow we're in Barcelona, which is one of the hubs for language industry, localization, all things in that space, so yeah.\nWe should probably do something in Barcelona at some point, some conference. But anyway, tell us more about, briefly, tell our listeners and viewers a bit more about\nyour background and kind of the initial origin story behind Happy Scribe. That's going to be a fun one.\nThe professional background is going to be rather short.\nI come from the Southwest of France where I did my high school and everything, and then I went to Paris.\nStudied kind of business more related topics, and after that, I went to Ireland, where I did a Masters in Ecommerce.\nSo it was half technology and business and just did one internship in the middle in the UK in London, where I was working\nfor Intuit, which is like a big US fintech. Happy Scribe started in the middle of that\nMasters, so I was doing this qualitative research around social entrepreneurs in\nIreland and I was looking at their motivation and aspiration. So I would like go every once in a while\nand go interview one about... and trying to understand what they would be doing. And once I did twelve interviews, I went back to the university and the researcher\nin charge of the research came to me and was like, okay, that's great, you did all these interviews, but now you've got to transcribe them and I'm like, okay, cool.\nI had no idea what transcription was or I had never done this in my life. So I go back home and I start transcribing and I do like the first ten minutes and\nI'm like, okay, this is literally going to take me ages to do it.\nBasically, I do one hour. It takes me like around six, seven hours to do one hour interview. And I'm like, okay, it's impossible that I\nspent just like 40, 50 hours transcribing interviews for this Master.\nI really didn't have the time. It was, you know, end of the year, final projects and everything. So like, I kind of go in the living room\nand I start talking with my flatmate, who is now the CTO of the company, Marc.\nHe was doing his bachelor's thesis on computer vision and artificial intelligence and we started talking about\nthis and we're like, okay, maybe let's try to find tools online, things that could help, and we couldn't really find anything.\nKnowing as well that we were students, so we couldn't pay external transcribers, to human resources to do the job and so we\nended up playing a bit with Google Speech- to-Text API that was released on the exact\nsame day and it was not amazing,\nespecially at that time compared to the results we're getting today. But this technology, the speech-to-text\ntechnology could help me and my research group save between, I don't know, 30 to 50\nof the time we would spend transcribing interviews. So I started using it, my research group started using it and I think one, two days\nafter we started receiving emails from PhD students, researchers in the university,\nthey were like, guys, we've just heard about what you were doing with this like speech-to-text, can you come in my lab and install it?\nThat would change my life. Mark and I were, the two of us, like kind of business oriented.\nLike we had tried to learn... before. We were like loving the ecosystem in Dublin and everything and we were like, okay, that's interesting.\nAnd so we kind of locked ourselves for 48 hours, the time of a weekend\nand we started like building the first version of what would become Happy Scribe with a web interface and all the backing behind.\nAnd the month after, we kind of launched, started having like 10, 20 people that\nwere using because we had posted the link on some forums and everything.\nAnd right after we get, like, I think maybe two days after we get an email of this journalist in the US that is like,\nguys, I saw your tool, it's a game changer. I'm going to write an article about it\nand the article goes out and it basically goes viral. We receive more than 50,000 views on the website and the website keeps crashing all\nthe time and that was really like a pivotal moment.\nThat's really when we decided, okay, there is something much bigger to build from this.\nAnd this is when we took the decision to basically start Happy Scribe and from that moment we went full time on it really.\nThat is insane. That's like instantly compressed the entire startup journey in like a couple of weeks, right?\nOkay. Notice the problem. Find in a sense like an alpha version,\nbuild it, product market fit, going viral with an article.\nIt was so insane and so intense at the same time. We were answering customer tickets during\nthe night and doing our exams during the day. But I think we learned so much on that\nphase, on this early stage because it was like,\none of the things that was really interesting that we were seeing all this industry and a bit less today, but still with a completely new eye,\nwithout any sort of previous experience in the market. So we were not trying to build a transcription tool.\nWe were trying to build a tool that will help journalists save time. I mean, you don't immediately comprehend\nthe entirety of whatever has been there before, right? You just see who's coming and knocking at\nyour door and then, okay, those are the people that we're building it for. Wow. So a lot has happened since.\nSo give us the, I don't know, three, four, five key milestones over the past five, six years since you've been online.\nAfter this happened, I think it took us maybe one year and a half for Mark and I to understand the industry.\nSo the first one, two years of Happy Scribe, we were in full opportunistic mode.\nWe were attacking every single project that was coming to us. We had some TV broadcasters coming to us\nand asking us to do subtitles in one language with human resources. We had never done that before, and we were saying yes to everything, and we're just\nlearning, learning, learning, learning, learning, learning. But after these two years, we're like,\nokay, doing this opportunistic approach is nice. We're learning a lot, but what do we want to do with Happy Scribe?\nWhere do we want to bring this? What do we envision for the future? And this is really when we decided to\nfocus a lot on the product, but the product in the goal\nto kind of work out the speech-to-text technology, to be able to work on the fundamental problem, which is the AI itself, the model itself.\nWhy? Because we realized that we were in a position that is quite exceptional, where\nHappy Scribe is as well, at the same time a product for the users, but at the same time a data in giant that is processing a lot of information.\nAnd when you look at the industry, and I think the latest model of Whisper\nbrought that back, is that to get a very good accuracy, actually,\ndata is one of the most important assets that you can have.\nAnd so that's kind of the strategy we took and on the product part,\nit was more about, okay, how can we build all-in-one platform for language needs?\nWe saw in these first years companies that would have transcription, translation, subtitle needs, both with human and AI.\nThey don't work the one a part of the other.
