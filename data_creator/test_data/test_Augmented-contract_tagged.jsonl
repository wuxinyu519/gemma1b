(\"MCI\") and Borden Chemical, Inc. (the \"Company\") are prepared to engage in discussions with respect to a possible negotiated business combination involving the Company and MCI (the \"Transaction\"), and during the course of such discussions MCI may disclose and make available to the Company certain information concerning MCI's business, prospects, financial condition, operations, technology, assets and liabilities. All such information furnished to the Company or its Representatives (as defined below) by or on behalf of MCI (irrespective of the form of communication and whether such information is furnished prior to, on or after the date hereof), and all analyses, compilations, data, studies, notes, interpretations, memoranda or other documents prepared by the Company or its Representatives containing or based in whole or in part on any such furnished information are collectively referred to herein as the \"Confidential Information.\" As a condition to being furnished the Confidential Information, the Company agrees as follows:\n1. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. (a) the Company shall (i) use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction and for no other competitive or other purpose; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, except for disclosures to its directors, officers, employees and representatives of its advisors (such as independent accountants, investment bankers and attorneys) acting on its behalf (such directors, officers, employees and representatives being referred to hereinafter collectively as its \"Representatives\") who in each case, in the Company's reasonable judgment, need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction; provided, however, that prospective financing sources shall not be considered \"Representatives\" to whom Confidential Information may be disclosed in accordance with this paragraph 1 unless specifically requested by the Company and consented to by MCI in writing; (iii) inform its Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and direct its Representatives to treat the Confidential Information confidentially; (iv) take all additional reasonable precautions necessary to prevent the disclosure of the Confidential Information by its Representatives to any third party; and (v) be responsible for any breach of this Agreement (the \"Agreement\") by its Representatives.\n(b) If the Company or its Representatives is requested (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, it is agreed that the Company will provide MCI with prompt notice of such request so that MCI may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive the Company's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Company and its Representatives may disclose without liability hereunder only that portion of the Confidential Information that the Company is advised by written opinion of counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided that the Company gives MCI written notice of the information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and, upon MCI's request, uses reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information.\n2. NON-DISCLOSURE OF NEGOTIATIONS OR AGREEMENTS. Except as required by law, neither the Company nor its Representatives shall disclose to any person the existence, status or terms of any discussions, negotiations or agreements concerning a possible Transaction, including without limitation any offer, letter of intent, proposal, price, value or valuation, or any similar terms, agreements or understandings between the Company and MCI with respect thereto, or that the Company has received from MCI Confidential Information, without obtaining the prior written consent of the other, which consent will not be withheld unreasonably.\n3.

Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, the Company and its Representatives will continue to be bound by the confidentiality and other obligations hereunder, until the expiration of three years from the date of this Agreement, unless a lesser duration is specified herein.\n4. INFORMATION NOT DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The term \"Confidential Information\" does not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Company or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement; or (ii) was or becomes available to the Company from a source other than MCI or its Representatives, provided that such source is not known by the Company to be bound by an obligation of confidentiality to MCI or its Representatives or (iii) was already known to the Company at the time of its disclosure by MCI.\n5. NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES. Neither MCI nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy and completeness of any Confidential Information provided by it, and no liability shall result to MCI from its use, except as set forth in a definitive agreement for a Transaction. Only the representations and warranties that are made in a definitive agreement for a Transaction, when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, shall have any legal effect.\n6. NO AGREEMENT. MCI has the absolute right to determine what information, properties and personnel it wishes to make available to the Company. Unless a definitive agreement regarding a Transaction between the Company and MCI has been executed and delivered, neither MCI, the Company nor any of their stockholders or affiliates will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such Transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, matters specifically agreed to herein.

The Company agrees that, for a period of two years from the date of this Agreement, it will not initiate or maintain contact (except in the ordinary course of business) with any director, officer, employee, distributor or customer of MCI regarding MCI's business operations, prospects or finances, except as may be permitted by the Contact Persons for due diligence purposes.

Saggese\nChairman\nDear Mr. Saggese:\nMelamine Chemicals, Inc. (\"MCI\") and Borden Chemical, Inc. (the \"Company\") are prepared to engage in discussions with respect to a possible negotiated business combination involving the Company and MCI (the \"Transaction\"), and during the course of such discussions MCI may disclose and make available to the Company certain information concerning MCI's business, prospects, financial condition, operations, technology, assets and liabilities. All such information furnished to the Company or its Representatives (as defined below) by or on behalf of MCI (irrespective of the form of communication and whether such information is furnished prior to, on or after the date hereof), and all analyses, compilations, data, studies, notes, interpretations, memoranda or other documents prepared by the Company or its Representatives containing or based in whole or in part on any such furnished information are collectively referred to herein as the \"Confidential Information.\" As a condition to being furnished the Confidential Information, the Company agrees as follows:\n1. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. (a) the Company shall (i) use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction and for no other competitive or other purpose; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, except for disclosures to its directors, officers, employees and representatives of its advisors (such as independent accountants, investment bankers and attorneys) acting on its behalf (such directors, officers, employees and representatives being referred to hereinafter collectively as its \"Representatives\") who in each case, in the Company's reasonable judgment, need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction; provided, however, that prospective financing sources shall not be considered \"Representatives\" to whom Confidential Information may be disclosed in accordance with this paragraph 1 unless specifically requested by the Company and consented to by MCI in writing; (iii) inform its Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and direct its Representatives to treat the Confidential Information confidentially; (iv) take all additional reasonable precautions necessary to prevent the disclosure of the Confidential Information by its Representatives to any third party; and (v) be responsible for any breach of this Agreement (the \"Agreement\") by its Representatives.\n(b) If the Company or its Representatives is requested (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, it is agreed that the Company will provide MCI with prompt notice of such request so that MCI may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive the Company's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Company and its Representatives may disclose without liability hereunder only that portion of the Confidential Information that the Company is advised by written opinion of counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided that the Company gives MCI written notice of the information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and, upon MCI's request, uses reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information.\n2. NON-DISCLOSURE OF NEGOTIATIONS OR AGREEMENTS. Except as required by law, neither the Company nor its Representatives shall disclose to any person the existence, status or terms of any discussions, negotiations or agreements concerning a possible Transaction, including without limitation any offer, letter of intent, proposal, price, value or valuation, or any similar terms, agreements or understandings between the Company and MCI with respect thereto, or that the Company has received from MCI Confidential Information, without obtaining the prior written consent of the other, which consent will not be withheld unreasonably.\n3. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. All written Confidential Information delivered by or on behalf of MCI to the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be and remain the property of MCI and upon the written request of MCI, the Company shall (i) promptly return such Confidential Information and shall not retain any copies or other reproductions or extracts thereof, (ii) destroy or have destroyed all memoranda, notes, reports, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, or other documents derived from or containing Confidential Information, and all copies and other reproductions and extracts thereof, and (iii) upon written request by MCI provide a certificate to MCI certifying that the foregoing materials have, in fact, been destroyed or returned, signed by an authorized officer supervising such destruction or return. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, the Company and its Representatives will continue to be bound by the confidentiality and other obligations hereunder, until the expiration of three years from the date of this Agreement, unless a lesser duration is specified herein.\n4. INFORMATION NOT DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The term \"Confidential Information\" does not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Company or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement; or (ii) was or becomes available to the Company from a source other than MCI or its Representatives, provided that such source is not known by the Company to be bound by an obligation of confidentiality to MCI or its Representatives or (iii) was already known to the Company at the time of its disclosure by MCI.\n5. NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES. Neither MCI nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy and completeness of any Confidential Information provided by it, and no liability shall result to MCI from its use, except as set forth in a definitive agreement for a Transaction. Only the representations and warranties that are made in a definitive agreement for a Transaction, when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, shall have any legal effect.\n6. NO AGREEMENT. MCI has the absolute right to determine what information, properties and personnel it wishes to make available to the Company. Unless a definitive agreement regarding a Transaction between the Company and MCI has been executed and delivered, neither MCI, the Company nor any of their stockholders or affiliates will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such Transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, matters specifically agreed to herein. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals made by the other party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Transaction, and to terminate discussions and negotiations with the other party at any time.\n7. CONTACT PERSONS; NO SOLICITATION. All requests by the Company for Confidential Information, meetings with personnel or inspection of properties and all other communications regarding a possible Transaction shall be made only to the contacts designated by MCI (the \"Contact Persons\"). The Company agrees that, for a period of two years from the date of this Agreement, it will not initiate or maintain contact (except in the ordinary course of business) with any director, officer, employee, distributor or customer of MCI regarding MCI's business operations, prospects or finances, except as may be permitted by the Contact Persons for due diligence purposes. It is expressly understood that this Agreement is not intended to limit the right of the parties to compete with one another in the ordinary course. The Company further agrees that, for a period of two years from the date hereof, it will not directly or indirectly offer employment to (other than by means of a general advertisement) or hire any of MCI's employees with whom it has had contact during the process contemplated by this Agreement.\n8. NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION. MCI has outstanding publicly-held securities and the Confidential Information contains material non-public information. The Company acknowledges that it is (i) aware, and has advised or will advise its Representatives, that the United States securities laws prohibit any person in possession of material non-public information about a company from purchasing or selling securities of such company, and from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person may purchase or sell such securities and (ii) familiar with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the rules and regulations thereunder, and the Company agrees that it will neither use nor permit any of its Representatives to use any Confidential Information in violation of such Act or rules or regulations, including without limitation Rule 10b-5.\n9. STANDSTILL. The Company agrees that, until the expiration of two years from the date of this Agreement, without the prior written invitation (on an unsolicited basis) of MCI's Board of Directors, it and its affiliates will not (i) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal or offer or otherwise seek to acquire, directly or indirectly, any securities (or rights in respect thereof), assets or property of MCI or any of its subsidiaries or of any successor thereto or person in control thereof, whether such agreements or proposals or offers are made with or to MCI or any of its subsidiaries (or a successor thereto or person in control thereof) or a third party; (ii) enter into or agree, offer, seek or propose to enter into or otherwise be involved in or part of, directly or indirectly, any merger, acquisition transaction or other business combination relating to MCI or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective assets; (iii) make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any \"solicitation\" of \"proxies\" (as such terms are used in the proxy rules under the Exchange Act) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of MCI or any of its subsidiaries or of any successor thereto or person in control thereof; (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a \"group\" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting securities of MCI or any of its subsidiaries or of any successor thereto or person in control thereof; (v) seek or propose, alone or in concert with others, to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of MCI; (vi) directly or indirectly enter into any discussions, negotiations, arrangements or understandings with any other person (except internal discussions and planning activities involving its Representatives) with respect to any of the foregoing activities or propose any of such activities to any other person (other than its Representatives); (vii) directly or indirectly advise, encourage, assist, act as a financing source for or otherwise invest in any other person in connection with any of the foregoing; or (viii) publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing. The Company also agrees that, during such two-year period, neither it nor any of its affiliates will: (i) request MCI or its advisors, directly or indirectly, to (1) amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence) or (2) otherwise consent to any action inconsistent with any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence); or (ii) take any initiative with respect to MCI or any of it's subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to require MCI to make a public announcement regarding (1) such initiative, (2) any of the activities referred to in this paragraph, (3) the possibility of a Transaction or any similar transaction or (4) the possibility of the Company's or any other person's acquiring control of MCI, whether by means of a business combination or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 9, the Company's chief executive officer may contact MCI's chief executive officer for the purpose of expressing continuing or renewed interest in a Transaction, provided that, unless invited to do so by MCI's chief executive officer, no offer or proposal shall be made that would require public disclosure or formal consideration by MCI or its Board of Directors.\n10. PERSON. The term \"person\" as used in this Agreement will be interpreted broadly to include the media and any corporation, company, group, partnership, governmental body or other entity or individual.\n11. NO WAIVER. No failure or delay by MCI in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n12. REMEDIES. It is understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Company and that MCI shall be entitled to equitable relief, including specific performance and injunction, as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by the Company but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to MCI, including remedies pursuant to applicable laws relating to trade secrets.\n13.

Accordingly, each party agrees that the restrictions and covenants contained in this Agreement are of the essence of this Agreement and constitute a material inducement by the each party to the other to disclose the Confidential Information.\nARTICLE 4 INJUNCTION\nThe parties hereto agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement and that in addition to other remedies, each offended party shall be entitled to specific performance\nand injunctive or other equitable relief, and in such circumstances the offending party agrees to waive posting of a bond to secure any such equitable relief hereunder.\nARTICLE 5 DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS; DISCLOSURE\nThe parties hereto will use their best efforts to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement and any other documents that may be necessary in order to consummate the Acquisition by October 31, 2007.

{"prompt": "Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement\n1. In connection with discussions between [INSERT LEGAL ENTITY NAME OF SUPPLIER] (“Company”) and the Wayne Fueling Systems LLC with respect to a transaction involving the purchase and/or sale of goods and/or services (the “Transaction”), each party (as to information disclosed by it, the “Disclosing Party”) is prepared to furnish the other party (as to information received by it, the “Receiving Party”) with certain confidential and proprietary information. “Confidential Information” as used in this agreement (the “Agreement”) shall mean all such information that is or has been disclosed by the Disclosing Party or its Affiliates (defined below): (i) in writing or by email or other tangible electronic storage medium and is clearly marked “Confidential” or “Proprietary”; or (ii) orally or visually, and then followed within ten (10) working days thereafter with a disclosure complying with the requirements of clause (i) above. Confidential Information also includes, but is not limited to, personal data as defined in this Agreement or by applicable law, whichever is broader, and personal data shall not be required to be marked “Confidential” or “Proprietary” to be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, “personal data” means any information relating: (i) to an identified; or (ii) to a directly or indirectly identifiable, natural person. All other information shall be deemed to be non-confidential. As used in this Agreement, an “Affiliate” with respect to a party means any entity (including without limitation any individual, corporation, company, partnership, limited liability company or group) that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such party.\n2. The Receiving Party agrees, except as required by law, to: (i) protect the confidentiality of the other party’s Confidential Information in whatever form maintained, including any notes, summaries, reports, analyses or other material derived by the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties (defined below), in whole or in part, from the Confidential Information (collectively, “Notes”); (ii) use the Confidential Information and Notes only for the purposes of evaluating a possible Transaction and the terms thereof; (iii) use the same degree of care as with its own confidential information, which shall be at least a reasonable standard of care, to prevent disclosure of the Confidential Information and Notes, except to its Affiliates, and its or their officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, representatives, service providers, consultants and/or subcontractors (collectively, “Authorized Parties”), solely to the extent necessary to permit them to assist the Receiving Party in evaluating the Transaction; and (iv) not disclose to persons (other than those described in clause (iii) above) that the Confidential Information has been made available, that the Receiving Party is considering a possible Transaction or that the parties have had or are having discussions or negotiations with respect thereto. The Receiving Party further agrees that prior to disclosing any Confidential Information to its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties, as allowed hereunder, such Affiliates and/or Authorized Parties will be advised of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, provided a copy of this Agreement and directed to abide by its terms. The Receiving Party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by it, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties. Each party acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity that a party may have, it shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief or specific performance or both (although neither party shall be entitled to any special, consequential, indirect, punitive or exemplary damages as a result of a breach of this Agreement, whether a claim is asserted in contract, tort, or otherwise). Obligations in this Section 2 regarding Confidential Information shall, with respect to each disclosure of Confidential Information hereunder, continue for three (3) years from the date of each disclosure of Confidential Information. Nothing herein is intended to limit or abridge the protection of trade secrets under applicable trade secrets law, and trade secrets shall be maintained as such until they fall into the public domain.\n3. This Agreement shall be inoperative as to particular portions of the Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party if such information: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties; (ii) was available on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to the Receiving Party; (iii) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party when such source is not, to the best of the Receiving Party’s knowledge, subject to a confidentiality obligation with the Disclosing Party; or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties, without reference to the Confidential Information, and the Receiving Party can verify the development of such information by written documentation.\n4. If either party decides not to proceed with a Transaction, it will promptly inform the other party of that decision. In addition, the Disclosing Party may elect at any time by notice to the Receiving Party to terminate further access to and such party’s review of the Confidential Information. In any such case or upon any other termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party will immediately: (i) return all Confidential Information disclosed to it and (ii) destroy, with such destruction to be certified by the Receiving Party, all Notes, without retaining any copy thereof. No such termination of the Agreement or return or destruction of the Confidential Information or Notes will affect the confidentiality obligations of the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties, all of which will continue in effect as provided in this Agreement.\n5. Each party shall retain ownership of all Confidential Information and intellectual property it had prior to commencement of the discussions and evaluation referred to in this Agreement, but WAYNE FUELING SYSTEMS LLC shall own exclusively all rights in ideas, inventions, works of authorship, strategies, plans and data created in or resulting from discussions between WAYNE FUELING SYSTEMS LLC and the Company, including but not limited to all patent rights, copyrights, moral rights, rights in proprietary information, database rights, trademark rights and other intellectual property rights, and the Company will execute assignments as necessary to achieve that result. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to grant a license directly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, although the parties may provide for such a license in an express written agreement.\n6. If either party or any of their respective Affiliates or Authorized Parties is requested or required, by interrogatories, subpoena or similar legal process, to disclose any Confidential Information or Notes, such party agrees to provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of each such request, to the extent practicable, so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order, waive compliance by the Receiving Party with the provisions of this Agreement, or both. If, absent the entry of a protective order or receipt of a waiver, the Receiving Party is, in the opinion of its counsel, legally compelled to disclose such Confidential Information or Notes, the Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information or Notes to the persons and to the extent required without liability under this Agreement and will use its best efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential Information or Notes so disclosed.\n7. This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties relating to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior and collateral communication, reports and understandings between the parties relating thereto. This Agreement is not intended as a teaming, joint venture or other such arrangement. No change, modification or addition to or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties. Except as provided herein, the parties agree that any disclosures contemplated hereunder, and any discussions or communications between the parties relating thereto, shall not restrict either party’s right to take whatever future actions such party unilaterally determines to be in its best interests, including the right to discontinue discussions with the other party at any time or to undertake similar discussions or to enter into agreements or relationships with third parties covering subjects related to the matters covered herein. All provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any provision or part thereof is deemed invalid or otherwise unenforceable, then such term shall be construed to reflect the closest lawful interpretation of the parties’ original intent, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain valid, enforceable and binding. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any signature page of any such counterpart, or any facsimile transmission thereof, may be attached or appended to any other counterpart to complete a fully executed counterpart of this Agreement, and any facsimile transmission of any signature of a party shall be deemed an original and shall bind such party. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any loss, unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information and/or Notes or any other breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties. In any such event, the Receiving Party shall help the Disclosing Party in every reasonable way to regain possession of the Confidential Information and/or Notes and shall prevent any further unauthorized disclosure or use. This Agreement will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except for the foregoing, neither party may assign this Agreement or any of their rights and obligations hereunder or delegate the performance thereof to a third party without the prior written consent of the other party. Except as stated herein, nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer any benefit to any third party or any right to enforce any term of this Agreement. Any failure by a party hereto to enforce the other party’s strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of that party’s right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.\n8. WAYNE FUELING SYSTEMS LLC and Company each agrees to take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that the disclosure of Confidential Information complies with any export control laws which may govern such disclosure. The Receiving Party represents and warrants that no technical data it receives in conjunction with the Confidential Information that is subject to the export control laws of the United States of America (“U.S.”) shall be exported from the U.S. or re-exported from any other country without first complying with all export control laws and regulations of the U.S. Government, including without limitation the requirement for obtaining any export license, if applicable. The Receiving Party shall indemnify and hold the Disclosing Party harmless from all claims, demands, damages, costs, fines, penalties, attorney’s fees and all other expenses arising from its, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties failure to comply with this clause and/or applicable export control laws and regulations.\n9.

Legally Required Disclosure.\nIf you or any of the Representatives are requested or required (in the opinion of your counsel) by order of court, legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand, a governmental agency, a stock exchange or other similar process to disclose any of the Evaluation Material or any of the facts, disclosure of which is prohibited under this Confidentiality Agreement, you will provide the Company with prompt written notice of any such requests or requirements together with copies of the material proposed to be disclosed so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Confidentiality Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Company, you or the Representatives are nonetheless legally compelled to disclose the Evaluation Material or any of the facts, disclosure of which is prohibited under this Confidentiality Agreement, or otherwise be liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, you or the Representatives in question may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such requiring Person only that portion of such Evaluation Material or any such facts which you or the Representatives, on the advice of your counsel, are legally required to disclose, provided that you or the Representatives shall exercise reasonable efforts to preserve the privileged nature and confidentiality of such Evaluation Material or any of such facts, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Company to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material or such facts by the Person receiving the material.\n4.

Return or Destruction of Evaluation Material.\nIf you decide that you do not wish to proceed with a possible Transaction, you will promptly inform the Company of this decision. In that case, or at any time upon the written request of the Company for any reason, you will, and will cause your Affiliates and the Representatives to, within ten (10) days after the request, destroy or return all Evaluation Material and no copy, extract, or other reproductions thereof (including electronic copies) shall be retained. No such termination will affect your obligations hereunder or those of the Representatives.

Maintaining Privileges.\nIf any Evaluation Material (including Evaluation Material related to pending or threatened litigation) includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege, you understand and agree that you and the Company have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of each party to this Confidentiality Agreement that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material provided to you that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Confidentiality Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.\n8. Not a Transaction Agreement.\nYou understand and agree that no contract or agreement providing for a Transaction shall be deemed to exist between you and the Company unless and until you and the Company execute and deliver a final definitive agreement relating to a Transaction (a “Transaction Agreement”), and you hereby waive, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) relating to the existence of a Transaction unless and until you and the Company shall have executed and delivered a Transaction Agreement. You also agree that, unless and until you and the Company shall have executed and delivered a Transaction Agreement, neither you nor the Company will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Transaction by virtue of this Confidentiality Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein.

No Representations or Warranties; No Obligation to Disclose.\nYou understand and acknowledge that the Company and its Affiliates and representatives have made and make no representation hereunder, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, expressly disclaim any and all liability for the information contained in or omitted from the Evaluation Material furnished by or on behalf of the Company and shall have no liability to you, your Affiliates or the Representatives or any other Person relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. The parties agree that the Company will only be liable for any representations or warranties which are made in a Transaction Agreement, when, as, and if executed and delivered, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein. Nothing in this Confidentiality Agreement shall be construed as obligating the Company to provide, or to continue to provide, any information to any Person. It is expected that you will conduct your own independent investigation of the Company and rely upon such investigation in making an investment decision regarding the Company.\n10. Remedies.\nIt is understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Confidentiality Agreement by you, your Affiliates or the Representatives, and that the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threat thereof. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Confidentiality Agreement and shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Company.\n11. Severability.\nIf any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Confidentiality Agreement is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and if a covenant or provision is determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extent, duration, scope or otherwise, then the parties intend and hereby request that the court or other authority making that determination shall only modify such extent, duration, scope or other provision to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and enforce them in their modified form for all purposes of this Confidentiality Agreement.\n12. Term.\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise herein, this Confidentiality Agreement will terminate two (2) years from the date hereof and be governed by Texas law.\n13. Modifications and Waiver.\nNo provision of this Confidentiality Agreement can be waived or amended in favor of the parties hereto except by written consent of the other party, which consent shall specifically refer to such provision and explicitly make such waiver or amendment. No failure or delay by either party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n14. Repositories.\nThe terms of this Confidentiality Agreement shall control over any additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by any offering memorandum, web-based database or similar repository of Evaluation Material to which the you or any of the Representatives is granted access in connection with the evaluation, negotiation or consummation of the Transaction, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, “clicking” on an “I Agree” icon or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being understood and agreed that its confidentiality obligations with respect to Evaluation Material are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be enlarged except by a written agreement that is hereafter executed by each of the parties hereto.\n15. Entire Agreement.\nThis Confidentiality Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, arrangements and discussions between the parties hereto regarding such subject matter.\nIf you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this Confidentiality Agreement, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.\n“Company” “Other Party”\nDAEGIS, INC.

No Solicitation.\nFor a period of one (1) year following the date of this Confidentiality Agreement, you will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any officer, director, or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or divisions in an executive or management level position or who is otherwise considered by the Company (in its sole discretion) to be a key employee, in each case, with whom you have had contact or became known to you in connection with your considerations of a Transaction, except that you shall not be deemed to be in violation of this provision as a result of any such employee who: (i) initiates discussions regarding such employment without any direct or indirect solicitation by you or (ii) responds to any public advertisement or search firm communications that are not directed specifically to any of the Persons described herein.\n7. Maintaining Privileges.\nIf any Evaluation Material (including Evaluation Material related to pending or threatened litigation) includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege, you understand and agree that you and the Company have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of each party to this Confidentiality Agreement that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material provided to you that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Confidentiality Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.\n8. Not a Transaction Agreement.\nYou understand and agree that no contract or agreement providing for a Transaction shall be deemed to exist between you and the Company unless and until you and the Company execute and deliver a final definitive agreement relating to a Transaction (a “Transaction Agreement”), and you hereby waive, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) relating to the existence of a Transaction unless and until you and the Company shall have executed and delivered a Transaction Agreement. You also agree that, unless and until you and the Company shall have executed and delivered a Transaction Agreement, neither you nor the Company will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Transaction by virtue of this Confidentiality Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. You further acknowledge and agree that the Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any proposals made by you, your Affiliates or any of the Representatives with regard to a Transaction, and to terminate discussion and negotiations with you at any time and for any reason or no reason. You understand that the Company shall be free to establish and change any process or procedure with respect to any possible Transaction as the Company in its sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any other interested party and entering into a final definitive agreement relating to a Transaction with any other party without prior notice to you or any other Person).\n9. No Representations or Warranties; No Obligation to Disclose.\nYou understand and acknowledge that the Company and its Affiliates and representatives have made and make no representation hereunder, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, expressly disclaim any and all liability for the information contained in or omitted from the Evaluation Material furnished by or on behalf of the Company and shall have no liability to you, your Affiliates or the Representatives or any other Person relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. The parties agree that the Company will only be liable for any representations or warranties which are made in a Transaction Agreement, when, as, and if executed and delivered, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein. Nothing in this Confidentiality Agreement shall be construed as obligating the Company to provide, or to continue to provide, any information to any Person. It is expected that you will conduct your own independent investigation of the Company and rely upon such investigation in making an investment decision regarding the Company.\n10. Remedies.\nIt is understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Confidentiality Agreement by you, your Affiliates or the Representatives, and that the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threat thereof. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Confidentiality Agreement and shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Company.\n11. Severability.\nIf any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Confidentiality Agreement is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and if a covenant or provision is determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extent, duration, scope or otherwise, then the parties intend and hereby request that the court or other authority making that determination shall only modify such extent, duration, scope or other provision to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and enforce them in their modified form for all purposes of this Confidentiality Agreement.\n12. Term.\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise herein, this Confidentiality Agreement will terminate two (2) years from the date hereof and be governed by Texas law.\n13. Modifications and Waiver.\nNo provision of this Confidentiality Agreement can be waived or amended in favor of the parties hereto except by written consent of the other party, which consent shall specifically refer to such provision and explicitly make such waiver or amendment. No failure or delay by either party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n14. Repositories.\nThe terms of this Confidentiality Agreement shall control over any additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by any offering memorandum, web-based database or similar repository of Evaluation Material to which the you or any of the Representatives is granted access in connection with the evaluation, negotiation or consummation of the Transaction, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, “clicking” on an “I Agree” icon or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being understood and agreed that its confidentiality obligations with respect to Evaluation Material are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be enlarged except by a written agreement that is hereafter executed by each of the parties hereto.\n15. Entire Agreement.\nThis Confidentiality Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, arrangements and discussions between the parties hereto regarding such subject matter.\nIf you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this Confidentiality Agreement, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.\n“Company” “Other Party”\nDAEGIS, INC.

If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by Provider, Recipient or any of its Representatives is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 or would otherwise be liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, Recipient or its respective Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such requiring Person only that portion of such Evaluation Material or any such facts which Recipient or its Representatives is legally required to disclose, provided that Recipient and/or its Representatives provide commercially reasonable assistance to Provider at Provider’s sole expense to seek an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material or such facts by the Person receiving the material.

Return or Destruction of Evaluation Material.

Maintaining Privileges. If any Evaluation Material includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the Parties that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.\n11. Compliance with Securities Laws. Recipient acknowledges that the Evaluation Material may include material nonpublic information (within the meaning of the securities laws of the United States) with respect to Provider.\n12. Not a Transaction Agreement. Recipient understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for a Possible Transaction exists between the Parties unless and until a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, and Recipient hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) relating to the existence of a Possible Transaction unless and until the Parties shall have entered into a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction. Recipient also agrees that, unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither of the Parties will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as obligating Provider to provide, or to continue to provide, any information to any Person.\n14. Modifications and Waiver. No provision of this Agreement can be waived or amended in favor of one of the Parties hereto except by written consent of the other Party, which consent shall specifically refer to such provision and explicitly make such waiver or amendment. No failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n15. Remedies. Recipient understands and agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by Recipient or any of its Representatives and that Provider shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threat thereof. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for Provider for a breach by Recipient or its Representatives of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to Provider.\n16. Legal Fees. In the event of a final, non-appealable order by a court of competent jurisdiction relating to a breach of this Agreement, the non-prevailing party shall reimburse the prevailing party the reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom.\n17. Governing Law.

Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either of the Parties by virtue of the authorship at any of the provisions of this Agreement.\n20. Term. This Agreement, and all obligations and other provisions hereunder, shall terminate two years after the date of this Agreement.\n21. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, arrangements and discussions between the Parties regarding such subject matter.\n22. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be deemed to constitute a single instrument.\n23.

Recipient agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of Recipient’s Representatives.\nThis Agreement does not grant Recipient or any of its Representatives any license to use the Provider’s Evaluation Material except as provided herein. In addition, all proprietary and intellectual property rights in and to the Evaluation Material shall remain the sole property of Provider, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed in any way to grant to Recipient or its Representatives or any other Person any express or implied option, license or other right, title or interest in or to any Evaluation Material, or to any intellectual property rights embodied in such Evaluation Material.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Vista Equity Partners III, LLC and/or its affiliates is engaged in the purchase and acquisition of, and investment in, software and technology-enabled companies. Accordingly, the mere purchase or acquisition of, or investment in, any other company without otherwise proving that this Agreement has been breached will not be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement.\n4. Non-Disclosure of Discussions. Subject to Section 5, Recipient agrees that, without the prior written consent of Provider, Recipient will not, and it will cause its Representatives not to, disclose to any other Person (i) that Evaluation Material has been provided to Recipient or Recipient’s Representatives, (ii) that discussions or negotiations are taking place between the Parties concerning a Possible Transaction or other transaction with the Provider or (iii) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof).\n5. Legally Required Disclosure. If Recipient or its Representatives are requested or required (by law, rule, regulation or any similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 above, Recipient shall (only to the extent legally permissible and reasonably practicable) provide Provider with prompt written notice (email is permissible) of any such request or requirement together with copies of the material proposed to be disclosed so that Provider may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by Provider, Recipient or any of its Representatives is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 or would otherwise be liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, Recipient or its respective Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such requiring Person only that portion of such Evaluation Material or any such facts which Recipient or its Representatives is legally required to disclose, provided that Recipient and/or its Representatives provide commercially reasonable assistance to Provider at Provider’s sole expense to seek an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material or such facts by the Person receiving the material. Any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Recipient or its Representatives in providing such assistance shall be paid or reimbursed by Provider within 10 business days of Recipient or its Representatives providing Provider notice of such expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Recipient and its Representatives shall be permitted to disclose any Evaluation Material without notice when pursuant to a routine, ordinary course supervisory examination or regulatory oversight by a regulator, bank examiner or self-regulatory organization, provided that such examination or oversight is not specifically directed at the Evaluation Material or a Possible Transaction.\n6. “Click Through” Agreements. The terms of this Agreement shall control over any additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by an offering memorandum or electronic database, dataroom, or similar repository of Evaluation Material to which Recipient or its Representatives are granted access in connection with this Agreement or a Possible Transaction, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, “clicking” on an “I Agree” icon or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being understood and agreed that Recipient’s and its Representatives’ confidentiality obligations with respect to the Evaluation Material are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be enlarged except by an agreement executed by the Parties hereto in traditional written format.\n7. Return or Destruction of Evaluation Material. Upon the written request (email is permissible) of Provider for any reason, Recipient will, and will direct its Representatives to, within ten business days after receipt of such notice or request, destroy or return all Evaluation Materials except to the extent stored as automated electronic “back-up” data in the ordinary course of business. The choice of which to destroy or return is at the sole discretion of Recipient and its Representatives. Recipient shall provide to Provider a certificate of compliance with the previous sentence signed by an executive officer of Recipient (email is permissible). Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, Recipient and its Representatives will continue to be bound by Recipient’s obligations hereunder with respect to such Evaluation Material. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient and its Representatives may maintain a copy of the Evaluation Material to the extent required by any applicable law, regulation or document retention policy.\n8. No Solicitation/Employment. Recipient will not, within one year from the date of this Agreement, directly or indirectly solicit the employment or consulting services of or employ or engage as a consultant any of the key employees of Provider with whom Recipient has had contact or of whom Recipient has become aware as a result of Recipient’s investigation contemplated herein, so long as they are employed by Provider and for one month after they cease to be employed by Provider. Recipient is not prohibited from soliciting or hiring any employee of Provider who (i) responds to a general solicitation of employment through an advertisement not specifically targeted at Provider or its employees, (ii) is referred to Recipient by search firms, employment agencies, or other similar entities, provided that such entities have not been specifically instructed by Recipient to solicit employees of Provider and (iii) contacts Recipient on his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation or encouragement.\n9. Standstill. Recipient’s Beneficial Ownership of the Provider’s capital stock as of the Effective Date is set forth on Schedule A attached hereto. Recipient agrees that, for a period of one year after the date of this Agreement (the “Standstill Period”), unless specifically invited in writing by Provider, neither it nor any of its affiliates who have been provided Evaluation Material, will in any manner, directly or indirectly:\n(a) effect, seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or cause or participate in, or in any way assist any other Person to effect, seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in:\n(i) any acquisition of any equity securities (or beneficial ownership thereof) or all or substantially all of the assets of Provider or any of its subsidiaries,\n(ii) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination involving Provider or any of its subsidiaries,\n(iii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to Provider or any of its subsidiaries, or\n(iv) any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents to vote any voting securities of Provider;\n(b) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (as defined under the 1934 Act) with respect to the securities of Provider;\n(c) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit an unsolicited proposal for or offer of (with or without condition), any extraordinary transaction involving Provider or its equity securities or assets;\n(d) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of Provider;\n(e) take any action which might force Provider to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in (a) above; or\n(f) enter into any discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing.\nRecipient also agrees during the Standstill Period not to publicly request (or request in a manner or under circumstances that would reasonably require public disclosure of such request) Provider (or its directors, officers, employees or agents), directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this Section 9 (including this sentence).\nRecipient further agrees that unless otherwise directed by Provider in writing (i) all communications with the Provider regarding a Possible Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, facility tours, or management meetings, and (iii) discussions or questions regarding procedures with respect to a Possible Transaction, will be submitted or directed by Recipient or its Representatives only to Ethan Zweig of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as Provider’s financial advisor, or a person or persons designated in writing by Mr. Zweig, unless otherwise agreed to by the Provider.\n10. Maintaining Privileges. If any Evaluation Material includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the Parties that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.\n11. Compliance with Securities Laws. Recipient acknowledges that the Evaluation Material may include material nonpublic information (within the meaning of the securities laws of the United States) with respect to Provider.\n12. Not a Transaction Agreement. Recipient understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for a Possible Transaction exists between the Parties unless and until a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, and Recipient hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) relating to the existence of a Possible Transaction unless and until the Parties shall have entered into a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction. Recipient also agrees that, unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither of the Parties will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. None of the Parties are under any obligation to accept any proposal regarding a Possible Transaction and the Parties may terminate discussions and negotiations at any time.\n13. No Representations or Warranties; No Obligation to Disclose. Recipient understands and acknowledges that neither Provider nor its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material furnished by or on behalf of Provider and shall have no liability to Recipient, its Representatives or any other Person relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material furnished to Recipient or its respective Representatives or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. As to the information delivered to Recipient, Provider will only be liable for those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as obligating Provider to provide, or to continue to provide, any information to any Person.\n14. Modifications and Waiver. No provision of this Agreement can be waived or amended in favor of one of the Parties hereto except by written consent of the other Party, which consent shall specifically refer to such provision and explicitly make such waiver or amendment. No failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n15. Remedies. Recipient understands and agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by Recipient or any of its Representatives and that Provider shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threat thereof. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for Provider for a breach by Recipient or its Representatives of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to Provider.\n16. Legal Fees. In the event of a final, non-appealable order by a court of competent jurisdiction relating to a breach of this Agreement, the non-prevailing party shall reimburse the prevailing party the reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom.\n17. Governing Law. This Agreement is for the benefit of each of the Parties and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state.\n18. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and if a covenant or provision is determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extent, duration, scope or otherwise, then the Parties intend and hereby request that the court or other authority making that determination shall only modify such extent, duration, scope or other provision to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and enforce them in their modified form for all purposes of this Agreement.\n19. Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either of the Parties by virtue of the authorship at any of the provisions of this Agreement.\n20. Term. This Agreement, and all obligations and other provisions hereunder, shall terminate two years after the date of this Agreement.\n21. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, arrangements and discussions between the Parties regarding such subject matter.\n22. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be deemed to constitute a single instrument.\n23. Consent to Representation. This agreement also constitutes notice to Recipient that Provider has engaged DLA Piper LLP (US) as its legal counsel in connection with the Possible Transaction, and Recipient hereby (i) consents to the continued representation of Provider by DLA Piper LLP (US) in relation to the Possible Transaction notwithstanding the fact that DLA Piper LLP (US) may have represented, and may currently or in the future represent, Recipient and/or any of its respective affiliates with respect to unrelated matters and (ii) waive any actual or alleged conflict and actual or alleged violation of ethical or comparable rules applicable to DLA Piper LLP (US) that may arise from its representation of Provider in connection with the Possible Transaction, including but not limited to representing Provider\nagainst Recipient and/or its affiliates in litigation, arbitration, or mediation in connection therewith.

{"prompt": "MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AND\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\n This Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (this \"Agreement\") is made this day of March, 2002, and effective as of February 26, 2002, between MDI Entertainment, Inc. (\"MDI\"), whose address is 201 Ann Street, 5th Floor, Hartford, Connecticut 06103 and Scientific Games Corporation (\"Scientific Games\") whose address is 750 Lexington Avenue, 25th Floor, New York, New York 10022.\nW I T N E S S E T H:\n WHEREAS, in connection with the analyses of a possible negotiated transaction between MDI and Scientific Games (collectively, the \"Companies\"), each of the Companies has requested or will request certain oral and written information concerning the other Company from the officers, directors, employees and/or agents of the respective Companies (collectively, the \"Evaluation Material\").\n NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, each of which is made a contractual part hereof, MDI and Scientific Games agree in consideration of furnishing the other party with the Evaluation Material (it being understood that the parties are also agreeing to cause such of their respective affiliates, representatives and agents, including but not limited to, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which are provided with the Evaluation Material to comply with the provisions hereof):\n (1) The Evaluation Material will be used solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction between the Companies and not in any way directly or indirectly detrimental to the Companies (competitively or otherwise), and unless and until the parties have completed a transaction pursuant to a formal contractually binding agreement (\"Definitive Agreement\"), such information will be kept confidential, except that each party may disclose the Evaluation Material or portions thereof to those of its directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and professional representatives (the persons to whom such disclosure is permissible being collectively called \"Representatives\") in each case who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction between the Companies; provided, however, that prior to disclosing the Evaluation Material or any portion thereof to any of such Representatives, the disclosing party will secure the undertaking of its Representative to be bound by the terms of this Confidentiality Agreement to the same extent that the disclosing party is bound by this Agreement. Each party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement or such undertaking by it or its Representatives. In the event that either party or any of its Representatives become legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material, such party shall provide the other party with prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the other party waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the disclosing party agrees to furnish only that portion of the Evaluation Material which it is advised by written opinion of its counsel is legally required and to exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material.\n (2) The term \"Evaluation Material\" does not include any information which (i) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to and known by the public (other than in the case of Evaluation Material for Scientific Games as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by MDI or its Representatives and in the case of Evaluation Material for MDI as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by Scientific Games or its Representatives), (ii) was or becomes available to Scientific Games or MDI on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the other party or its advisors, provided that such source is not and was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with or for the benefit of the party with respect to whom the information pertains, or (iii) was in the possession of the disclosing party prior to the date of this Agreement and was obtained by such party without the breach, directly or indirectly, by such party or any other person of any obligation or duty owed to the party with respect to whom the information pertains.\n (3) If a transaction between the Companies is not consummated or if either party at any time so requests, each party will promptly return to the other party all copies of the Evaluation Material in its possession or in the possession of its Representatives, and each party will destroy all copies of any analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by it or for its use containing or reflecting any Evaluation Material.\n (4) Without the prior written consent of the other party, each party will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, disclose to any person either the status of the investigations, discussions or negotiations taking place concerning a possible transaction between the parties, or that either party has requested or received Evaluation Material from the other party or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible transaction except as disclosed in that certain letter of intent between the parties dated February 25, 2002. The term \"person\" as used in this Agreement will be interpreted broadly to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership or individual. The obligations of Scientific Games and MDI under this paragraph (4) shall be subject to their disclosure obligations under federal and state securities laws.\n (5) It is understood that each party will arrange for appropriate contacts for due diligence purposes. It is further understood that all (i) communications regarding the possible negotiated transaction contemplated hereby, (ii) requests for additional information, (ii) requests for facility tours or management meetings and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed, in the case of Scientific Games, to Mr. Martin E. Schloss or Mr. C. Gray Bethea, Jr., and in the case of MDI, to Steve M. Saferin or Kenneth M. Przysiecki.\n (6) Each party understands and acknowledges that the other party is making no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material, and neither the disclosing party, nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, affiliates or agents will have any liability to the other party or any other person resulting from such other party's use of the Evaluation Material. Only those representations or warranties that are made to MDI or Scientific Games, as the case may be, in a Definitive Agreement when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Definitive Agreement, will have any legal effect.\n (7) Each party also understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for any transaction shall be deemed to exist between the parties unless and until a Definitive Agreement has been executed and delivered, and each party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with or involving the other party or any of its businesses based on the purported existence of any such contract or agreement unless and until and only to the extent that the parties shall have entered into a Definitive Agreement with respect to which a breach is alleged. Each party also agrees that unless and until a Definitive Agreement between the parties with respect to a negotiated transaction has been executed and delivered, neither of the parties nor their stockholders has any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"Definitive Agreement\" does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any written or verbal acceptance of an offer or bid on the part of either party. Each party further understands that (i) each party shall be free to negotiate for or with respect to any transaction respecting itself or any or all of its business as such party in its sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any of prospective merger partners, sellers or buyers and entering into a Definitive Agreement respecting any thereof without prior notice to the other party or any other person) and (ii) each party shall not have any claims whatsoever against the other party, or any of such other party's respective directors, officers, stockholders, affiliates or agents arising out of or relating to any such transaction (other than those as against the parties to a Definitive Agreement with you in accordance with the terms thereof). Neither this paragraph nor any other provision in this Agreement can be waived or amended except by written consent of the party which is sought to be bound, which consent shall specifically make such waiver or amendment.\n (8) Each party agrees that the other party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement, in addition to all other remedies available to the other part at law or in equity.\n (9) It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

(\"MDI\"), whose address is 201 Ann Street, 5th Floor, Hartford, Connecticut 06103 and Scientific Games Corporation (\"Scientific Games\") whose address is 750 Lexington Avenue, 25th Floor, New York, New York 10022.\nW I T N E S S E T H:\n WHEREAS, in connection with the analyses of a possible negotiated transaction between MDI and Scientific Games (collectively, the \"Companies\"), each of the Companies has requested or will request certain oral and written information concerning the other Company from the officers, directors, employees and/or agents of the respective Companies (collectively, the \"Evaluation Material\").\n NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, each of which is made a contractual part hereof, MDI and Scientific Games agree in consideration of furnishing the other party with the Evaluation Material (it being understood that the parties are also agreeing to cause such of their respective affiliates, representatives and agents, including but not limited to, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which are provided with the Evaluation Material to comply with the provisions hereof):\n (1) The Evaluation Material will be used solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction between the Companies and not in any way directly or indirectly detrimental to the Companies (competitively or otherwise), and unless and until the parties have completed a transaction pursuant to a formal contractually binding agreement (\"Definitive Agreement\"), such information will be kept confidential, except that each party may disclose the Evaluation Material or portions thereof to those of its directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and professional representatives (the persons to whom such disclosure is permissible being collectively called \"Representatives\") in each case who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction between the Companies; provided, however, that prior to disclosing the Evaluation Material or any portion thereof to any of such Representatives, the disclosing party will secure the undertaking of its Representative to be bound by the terms of this Confidentiality Agreement to the same extent that the disclosing party is bound by this Agreement. Each party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement or such undertaking by it or its Representatives. In the event that either party or any of its Representatives become legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material, such party shall provide the other party with prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the other party waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the disclosing party agrees to furnish only that portion of the Evaluation Material which it is advised by written opinion of its counsel is legally required and to exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material.\n (2) The term \"Evaluation Material\" does not include any information which (i) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to and known by the public (other than in the case of Evaluation Material for Scientific Games as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by MDI or its Representatives and in the case of Evaluation Material for MDI as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by Scientific Games or its Representatives), (ii) was or becomes available to Scientific Games or MDI on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the other party or its advisors, provided that such source is not and was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with or for the benefit of the party with respect to whom the information pertains, or (iii) was in the possession of the disclosing party prior to the date of this Agreement and was obtained by such party without the breach, directly or indirectly, by such party or any other person of any obligation or duty owed to the party with respect to whom the information pertains.\n (3) If a transaction between the Companies is not consummated or if either party at any time so requests, each party will promptly return to the other party all copies of the Evaluation Material in its possession or in the possession of its Representatives, and each party will destroy all copies of any analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by it or for its use containing or reflecting any Evaluation Material.\n (4) Without the prior written consent of the other party, each party will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, disclose to any person either the status of the investigations, discussions or negotiations taking place concerning a possible transaction between the parties, or that either party has requested or received Evaluation Material from the other party or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible transaction except as disclosed in that certain letter of intent between the parties dated February 25, 2002. The term \"person\" as used in this Agreement will be interpreted broadly to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership or individual. The obligations of Scientific Games and MDI under this paragraph (4) shall be subject to their disclosure obligations under federal and state securities laws.\n (5) It is understood that each party will arrange for appropriate contacts for due diligence purposes. It is further understood that all (i) communications regarding the possible negotiated transaction contemplated hereby, (ii) requests for additional information, (ii) requests for facility tours or management meetings and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed, in the case of Scientific Games, to Mr. Martin E. Schloss or Mr. C. Gray Bethea, Jr., and in the case of MDI, to Steve M. Saferin or Kenneth M. Przysiecki.\n (6) Each party understands and acknowledges that the other party is making no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material, and neither the disclosing party, nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, affiliates or agents will have any liability to the other party or any other person resulting from such other party's use of the Evaluation Material. Only those representations or warranties that are made to MDI or Scientific Games, as the case may be, in a Definitive Agreement when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Definitive Agreement, will have any legal effect.\n (7) Each party also understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for any transaction shall be deemed to exist between the parties unless and until a Definitive Agreement has been executed and delivered, and each party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with or involving the other party or any of its businesses based on the purported existence of any such contract or agreement unless and until and only to the extent that the parties shall have entered into a Definitive Agreement with respect to which a breach is alleged. Each party also agrees that unless and until a Definitive Agreement between the parties with respect to a negotiated transaction has been executed and delivered, neither of the parties nor their stockholders has any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"Definitive Agreement\" does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any written or verbal acceptance of an offer or bid on the part of either party. Each party further understands that (i) each party shall be free to negotiate for or with respect to any transaction respecting itself or any or all of its business as such party in its sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any of prospective merger partners, sellers or buyers and entering into a Definitive Agreement respecting any thereof without prior notice to the other party or any other person) and (ii) each party shall not have any claims whatsoever against the other party, or any of such other party's respective directors, officers, stockholders, affiliates or agents arising out of or relating to any such transaction (other than those as against the parties to a Definitive Agreement with you in accordance with the terms thereof). Neither this paragraph nor any other provision in this Agreement can be waived or amended except by written consent of the party which is sought to be bound, which consent shall specifically make such waiver or amendment.\n (8) Each party agrees that the other party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement, in addition to all other remedies available to the other part at law or in equity.\n (9) It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The obligations of the parties under this Agreement will expire three (3) years from the date of this Agreement.\n IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, by their duly authorized officers have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above.\nSCIENTIFIC GAMES CORPORATION\nBy: /s/ MARTIN E.

{"prompt": "EXECUTION COPY\nAMENDED AND RESTATED MUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Amended and Restated Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement (this “Agreement”), by and between JDA Software Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “JDA”), and RedPrairie Holding, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries and New Mountain Capital, LLC, “RHI”) (each a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), is dated as of the latest date set forth on the signature page hereto.\n1. General. In connection with the consideration of a possible transaction involving RHI and JDA (a “Possible Transaction”), the Party referred to as the “Provider” is prepared to make available to the Party referred to as the “Recipient” certain “Evaluation Material” (as defined in Section 2 below) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions as hereinafter set forth.\n2. Definitions.\n(a) The term “Evaluation Material” means information concerning the Provider which is furnished on or after November 8, 2011 to the Recipient or its Representatives (as defined below) on the Recipient's behalf in connection with the Recipient’s evaluation of a Possible Transaction, including its business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities, and includes all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by the Recipient or its Representatives to the extent containing or which are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished by the Provider hereunder, The term Evaluation Material does not include information which (i) is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by the Recipient or its Representatives in breach of this Agreement, (ii) was within the Recipient’s or its Representatives possession prior to its being furnished to the Recipient or its Representatives by or on behalf of the Provider, provided that the source of such information was not known by the Recipient or its Representatives to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Provider with respect to such information, (iii) is or becomes available to the Recipient or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Provider or its Representatives, provided that the source of such information was not known by the Recipient or its Representatives to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Provider with respect to such information, or (iv) was or is independently developed by the Recipient or the Recipient’s Representatives without the use of or reference to any Evaluation Material provided by or on behalf of Provider or its Representatives.\n(b) The term “Representatives” in the case of JDA shall mean the directors, officers, employees, counsel, investment bankers, financial advisors, agents, consultants, advisors, accountants or auditors of JDA. The term “Representatives” in the case of RHI shall mean the directors, officers, employees, counsel, and with prior written consent of JDA (not to be unreasonably withheld), investment bankers, financial advisors, potential sources of capital or financing (debt or equity), agents, consultants, advisors, accountants or auditors of RHI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the ability of RHI to discuss with, or engage, Greenhill & Co, or Bain & Company to act as its consultant, investment banker or financial advisor in connection with a Possible Transaction or to discuss with, or engage, Deloitte as its advisor or accountant in connection with a Possible Transaction.\n(c) The term “Person” includes the media and any corporation, partnership, group, individual or other entity.\n3. Use of Evaluation Material. The Recipient and its Representatives will use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction and, subject to Section 5, will not disclose any of the Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that any of such information may be disclosed to the Recipient’s Representatives for the purpose of helping the Recipient evaluate a Possible Transaction. The Recipient agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of the Recipient’s Representatives, other than those of Recipient’s unaffiliated Representatives who have entered into a separate confidentiality agreement with the Provider. This Agreement does not grant the Recipient or any of its Representatives any license to use the Provider’s Evaluation Material except as provided herein. For the avoidance of doubt, RHI agrees that it shall not disclose any of the Evaluation Material provided by or on behalf of JDA to any of its affiliates that are not included in the definition of RHI.\n4. Non-Disclosure of Discussions. Subject to Section 5, each Party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other Party, such Party and its Representatives will not disclose to any other Person (i) that Evaluation Material has been exchanged between the Parties, (ii) that discussions or negotiations are taking place between the Parties concerning a Possible Transaction or (iii) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof); provided, however, that JDA may make such disclosure if it does not identify RHI by name or by identifiable description. RHI agrees that neither RHI nor any Representative (to the extent acting on behalf or at the direction of RHI) of RHI will, without the prior consent of JDA (not to be unreasonably withheld), directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any other person regarding a Possible Transaction (including, without limitation, financing thereof). RHI represents and warrants that, except as disclosed to JDA or its outside counsel prior to the date hereof, neither RHI nor any Representative of RHI have, prior to the date hereof, taken any of the actions referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. Without limiting the foregoing, RHI agrees that neither RHI nor any Representative (to the extent acting on behalf and at the direction of RHI) of RHI will, without the prior written consent of JDA, enter into any exclusive arrangement with respect to the provision of debt financing in connection with a Possible Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, any agreement, arrangement or other understanding, whether written or oral, with any potential debt financing source which does, or could be reasonably expected to, legally or contractually limit, restrict or otherwise impair in any manner, directly or indirectly, such financing source from acting as a potential debt financing source to any other party with respect to a Potential Transaction shall be deemed an exclusive arrangement.\n5. Legally Required Disclosure. If the Recipient or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, other requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 above, the Recipient or such Representative shall provide the Provider with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Provider, the Recipient or any of its Representatives is nonetheless legally compelled or required by law to disclose Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4, the Recipient or its Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such requiring Person only that portion of such Evaluation Material or any such facts which the Recipient or its Representatives is legally compelled or required by law to disclose; provided that the Recipient and/or its Representatives exercise its commercially reasonable efforts, at the Provider’s sole expense, to preserve the confidentiality of such Evaluation Material or any of such facts, including, without limitation, by reasonably cooperating with the Provider to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material or such facts by the Person receiving the material. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient and its Representatives may disclose such information, and need not provide such notice, in connection with a routine blanket audit or proceeding (including in response to oral questions or requests for information or documents) involving the Recipient or its Representatives, as applicable, by a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the Recipient or such Representative where neither the Provider nor the Possible Transaction is the target of such proceeding or audit. In either case, the Recipient and its Representatives shall take reasonable measures to obtain confidential treatment with respect to any such information disclosed.\n6. No Contacts. Neither Party nor any of its Representatives will, in connection with its consideration of a Possible Transaction, initiate or maintain any contact with any officer, director, employee, agent, supplier, customer, lender or competitor of the other Party, except with the prior written consent of the other Party. If discussions between the Parties regarding a Possible Transaction are terminated, the Parties and their Representatives shall promptly cease all such contacts that may have been previously authorized. Unless otherwise consented to by RHI or JDA, as applicable, in writing, all communications regarding a Possible Transaction, including (i) requests for information, (ii) requests for facility tours or management meetings, (iii) discussions or questions regarding procedures, and (iv) requests for any consent required under this Agreement, will be submitted or directed (a) in the case of RHI, to Jack Qian at New Mountain Capital LLC (212-220-5040; jqian@newmountaincapital.com), or Paul Ilse at RHI (678-639-5398; Paul.IIse@RedPrairie.com), and (b) in the case of JDA, to David Lubeck (415- 315-8612; david.w.lubeck@jpmorgan.com) or Drago Rajkovic (415-315-8100; drago.rajkovic@jpmorgan.com) of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or their designees.\n7. “Click Through” Agreements. The terms of this Agreement shall control over any additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by an offering memorandum or electronic database, dataroom, or similar repository of Evaluation Material to which the Recipient or its Representatives are granted access in connection with this Agreement or a Possible Transaction, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, “clicking” on an “I Agree” icon or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being understood and agreed that the Recipient’s and its Representatives’ confidentiality obligations with respect to the Evaluation Material are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be enlarged except by an agreement executed by the Parties hereto in traditional written format.\n8. Termination of Discussions. If either Party decides that it does not wish to proceed with a Possible Transaction, it will promptly inform the other Party of that decision. In that case, or at any time upon the written request of the Provider for any reason, the Recipient will, and will direct its Representatives to, within five business days after receipt of such notice or request, destroy or return all Evaluation Material in any way relating to the Provider or its products, services, employees or other assets or liabilities, and no copy or extract thereof (including electronic copies) shall be retained (except that one copy may be maintained by outside legal counsel to the Recipient for archival purposes), and the term of this Agreement shall be extended by a like number of days for each day that the Recipient or any of its Representatives is in non-compliance of this Section 8. The Recipient shall provide to the Provider a certificate of compliance with the previous sentence. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, the Recipient and its Representatives will continue to be bound by the Recipient’s obligations hereunder with respect to such Evaluation Material.\n9. No Solicitation. The Recipient will not, within one year from the date of this Agreement, solicit the employment or consulting services of any of the officers of the Provider with whom it has had contact in connection with its evaluation of a Possible Transaction, so long as they are employed by the Provider. The Recipient is not prohibited from: (i) soliciting by means of a general advertisement not directed at any particular individual or the employees of the Provider generally, or (ii) engaging any recruiting firm or similar organization to identify or solicit individuals for employment on behalf of the Recipient (and soliciting any person identified by any such recruiting firm or organization) so long as the Recipient does not identify the individuals to be solicited by such recruiting firm or organization.\n10. Standstill. RHI agrees that, for a period ending on the earlier of (x) one year after the date of this Agreement, (y) the date a public announcement is made of the entry by JDA into a binding definitive agreement with any third party to effect a purchase, tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination that, if consummated, would result in a third party owning at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities of JDA or all or substantially all of the assets of JDA and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (z) the date of commencement by a third party of a tender or exchange offer for at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities of JDA (the “Standstill Period”), unless specifically invited in writing by JDA or its Representatives, neither RHI nor any of its affiliates (as such term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”)) which has been furnished with Evaluation Material pursuant hereto (including New Mountain Capital LLC) or Representatives (acting on its behalf) will in any manner, directly or indirectly:\n(a) effect, seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or cause or participate in, or in any way assist any other Person to effect, seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in:\n(i) any acquisition of the equity securities (or beneficial ownership thereof) or any material assets of JDA or any of its subsidiaries,\n(ii) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination involving JDA or any of its subsidiaries,\n(iii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to JDA or any of its subsidiaries, or\n(iv) any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents to vote any voting securities of JDA;\n(b) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (as defined under the 1934 Act with respect to the voting securities of JDA;\n(c) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit an unsolicited proposal for or offer of (with or without condition), any extraordinary transaction involving JDA or its voting securities or assets;\n(d) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to change, control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of JDA;\n(e) take any action which might force JDA to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in (a) above;\n(f) enter into any discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing; or\n(g) make any public announcement inconsistent with the agreements contained in this Section,\nRHI also agrees during the Standstill Period not to request (either directly or through its affiliates or Representatives) that JDA (or its directors, officers, employees or agents), directly or indirectly, amend or waive any provision of this Section 10 (including this sentence) if such request would require JDA to publicly disclose such request. In no event shall this Section 10 be construed as prohibiting the taking of any of the aforementioned actions with respect to any Person other than JDA or any of its subsidiaries notwithstanding the fact that, at the time such action is taken, JDA (or a subsidiary thereof) may be a subsidiary of such Person.\n11. Maintaining Privileges. If any Evaluation Material includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each Party understands and agrees that the Parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the Parties that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material provided by a Party that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.\n12. Compliance with Securities Laws. The Recipient and its Representatives agree not to use any Evaluation Material of the Provider in violation of applicable securities laws.\n13. Not a Transaction Agreement. Each Party understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for a Possible Transaction exists between the Parties unless and until a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, and each Party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) relating to the existence of a Possible Transaction unless and until both Parties shall have entered into a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction. Each Party also agrees that, unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein.\n14. No Representations or Warranties: No Obligation to Disclose. The Recipient understands and acknowledges that neither the Provider nor its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material furnished by or on behalf of the Provider and shall have no liability to the Recipient, its Representatives or any other Person relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material furnished to the Recipient or its Representatives or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. As to the information delivered to the Recipient, the Provider will only be liable for those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as obligating a Party to provide, or to continue to provide, any information to any Person.\n15. Modifications and Waiver. No provision of this Agreement can be waived or amended in favor of either Party except by written consent of the other Party, which consent shall specifically refer to such provision and explicitly make such waiver or amendment. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n16. Remedies. Each Party understands and agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by either Party or any of its Representatives and that the Party against which such breach is committed shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threat thereof without the requirement of posting a bond or other security. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by either Party of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Party against which such breach is committed. If a court of competent jurisdiction, pursuant to a final, non-appealable order, determines that the Recipient or any of its Representatives has breached this Agreement, the Recipient shall pay the reasonable costs (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Provider in enforcing this Agreement.\n17. Governing Law. This Agreement is for the benefit of each Party and its successors (including any purchaser of such Party) and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement may be enforced by any Person with which the Recipient enters into a transaction. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the State of Delaware, New Castle County, for the purpose of any action, suit or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and agree not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in any such court, and further agree that service of process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to its address set forth in this Agreement will be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each Party hereby also irrevocably and unconditionally (i) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any such federal and state courts, and (ii) waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n18. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and if a covenant or provision is determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extent, duration, scope or otherwise, then the Parties intend and hereby request that the court or other authority making that determination shall only modify such extent, duration, scope or other provision to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and enforce them in their modified form for all purposes of this Agreement.\n19. Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the authorship at any of the provisions of this Agreement.\n20. Term. This Agreement shall terminate two years after the date of this Agreement.\n21. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, arrangements and discussions between the Parties regarding such subject matter (including that certain Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement, dated November 8, 2011, between JDA Software Group, Inc. and RedPrairie Holding, Inc.).\n22.

Definitions.\n(a) The term “Evaluation Material” means information concerning the Provider which is furnished on or after November 8, 2011 to the Recipient or its Representatives (as defined below) on the Recipient's behalf in connection with the Recipient’s evaluation of a Possible Transaction, including its business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities, and includes all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by the Recipient or its Representatives to the extent containing or which are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished by the Provider hereunder, The term Evaluation Material does not include information which (i) is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by the Recipient or its Representatives in breach of this Agreement, (ii) was within the Recipient’s or its Representatives possession prior to its being furnished to the Recipient or its Representatives by or on behalf of the Provider, provided that the source of such information was not known by the Recipient or its Representatives to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Provider with respect to such information, (iii) is or becomes available to the Recipient or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Provider or its Representatives, provided that the source of such information was not known by the Recipient or its Representatives to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Provider with respect to such information, or (iv) was or is independently developed by the Recipient or the Recipient’s Representatives without the use of or reference to any Evaluation Material provided by or on behalf of Provider or its Representatives.\n(b) The term “Representatives” in the case of JDA shall mean the directors, officers, employees, counsel, investment bankers, financial advisors, agents, consultants, advisors, accountants or auditors of JDA. The term “Representatives” in the case of RHI shall mean the directors, officers, employees, counsel, and with prior written consent of JDA (not to be unreasonably withheld), investment bankers, financial advisors, potential sources of capital or financing (debt or equity), agents, consultants, advisors, accountants or auditors of RHI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the ability of RHI to discuss with, or engage, Greenhill & Co, or Bain & Company to act as its consultant, investment banker or financial advisor in connection with a Possible Transaction or to discuss with, or engage, Deloitte as its advisor or accountant in connection with a Possible Transaction.\n(c) The term “Person” includes the media and any corporation, partnership, group, individual or other entity.\n3. Use of Evaluation Material. The Recipient and its Representatives will use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction and, subject to Section 5, will not disclose any of the Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that any of such information may be disclosed to the Recipient’s Representatives for the purpose of helping the Recipient evaluate a Possible Transaction. The Recipient agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of the Recipient’s Representatives, other than those of Recipient’s unaffiliated Representatives who have entered into a separate confidentiality agreement with the Provider. This Agreement does not grant the Recipient or any of its Representatives any license to use the Provider’s Evaluation Material except as provided herein. For the avoidance of doubt, RHI agrees that it shall not disclose any of the Evaluation Material provided by or on behalf of JDA to any of its affiliates that are not included in the definition of RHI.\n4. Non-Disclosure of Discussions. Subject to Section 5, each Party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other Party, such Party and its Representatives will not disclose to any other Person (i) that Evaluation Material has been exchanged between the Parties, (ii) that discussions or negotiations are taking place between the Parties concerning a Possible Transaction or (iii) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof); provided, however, that JDA may make such disclosure if it does not identify RHI by name or by identifiable description. RHI agrees that neither RHI nor any Representative (to the extent acting on behalf or at the direction of RHI) of RHI will, without the prior consent of JDA (not to be unreasonably withheld), directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any other person regarding a Possible Transaction (including, without limitation, financing thereof). RHI represents and warrants that, except as disclosed to JDA or its outside counsel prior to the date hereof, neither RHI nor any Representative of RHI have, prior to the date hereof, taken any of the actions referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. Without limiting the foregoing, RHI agrees that neither RHI nor any Representative (to the extent acting on behalf and at the direction of RHI) of RHI will, without the prior written consent of JDA, enter into any exclusive arrangement with respect to the provision of debt financing in connection with a Possible Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, any agreement, arrangement or other understanding, whether written or oral, with any potential debt financing source which does, or could be reasonably expected to, legally or contractually limit, restrict or otherwise impair in any manner, directly or indirectly, such financing source from acting as a potential debt financing source to any other party with respect to a Potential Transaction shall be deemed an exclusive arrangement.\n5. Legally Required Disclosure. If the Recipient or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, other requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 above, the Recipient or such Representative shall provide the Provider with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Provider, the Recipient or any of its Representatives is nonetheless legally compelled or required by law to disclose Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4, the Recipient or its Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such requiring Person only that portion of such Evaluation Material or any such facts which the Recipient or its Representatives is legally compelled or required by law to disclose; provided that the Recipient and/or its Representatives exercise its commercially reasonable efforts, at the Provider’s sole expense, to preserve the confidentiality of such Evaluation Material or any of such facts, including, without limitation, by reasonably cooperating with the Provider to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material or such facts by the Person receiving the material. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient and its Representatives may disclose such information, and need not provide such notice, in connection with a routine blanket audit or proceeding (including in response to oral questions or requests for information or documents) involving the Recipient or its Representatives, as applicable, by a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the Recipient or such Representative where neither the Provider nor the Possible Transaction is the target of such proceeding or audit. In either case, the Recipient and its Representatives shall take reasonable measures to obtain confidential treatment with respect to any such information disclosed.\n6. No Contacts. Neither Party nor any of its Representatives will, in connection with its consideration of a Possible Transaction, initiate or maintain any contact with any officer, director, employee, agent, supplier, customer, lender or competitor of the other Party, except with the prior written consent of the other Party. If discussions between the Parties regarding a Possible Transaction are terminated, the Parties and their Representatives shall promptly cease all such contacts that may have been previously authorized. Unless otherwise consented to by RHI or JDA, as applicable, in writing, all communications regarding a Possible Transaction, including (i) requests for information, (ii) requests for facility tours or management meetings, (iii) discussions or questions regarding procedures, and (iv) requests for any consent required under this Agreement, will be submitted or directed (a) in the case of RHI, to Jack Qian at New Mountain Capital LLC (212-220-5040; jqian@newmountaincapital.com), or Paul Ilse at RHI (678-639-5398; Paul.IIse@RedPrairie.com), and (b) in the case of JDA, to David Lubeck (415- 315-8612; david.w.lubeck@jpmorgan.com) or Drago Rajkovic (415-315-8100; drago.rajkovic@jpmorgan.com) of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or their designees.\n7. “Click Through” Agreements. The terms of this Agreement shall control over any additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by an offering memorandum or electronic database, dataroom, or similar repository of Evaluation Material to which the Recipient or its Representatives are granted access in connection with this Agreement or a Possible Transaction, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, “clicking” on an “I Agree” icon or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being understood and agreed that the Recipient’s and its Representatives’ confidentiality obligations with respect to the Evaluation Material are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be enlarged except by an agreement executed by the Parties hereto in traditional written format.\n8. Termination of Discussions. If either Party decides that it does not wish to proceed with a Possible Transaction, it will promptly inform the other Party of that decision. In that case, or at any time upon the written request of the Provider for any reason, the Recipient will, and will direct its Representatives to, within five business days after receipt of such notice or request, destroy or return all Evaluation Material in any way relating to the Provider or its products, services, employees or other assets or liabilities, and no copy or extract thereof (including electronic copies) shall be retained (except that one copy may be maintained by outside legal counsel to the Recipient for archival purposes), and the term of this Agreement shall be extended by a like number of days for each day that the Recipient or any of its Representatives is in non-compliance of this Section 8. The Recipient shall provide to the Provider a certificate of compliance with the previous sentence. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, the Recipient and its Representatives will continue to be bound by the Recipient’s obligations hereunder with respect to such Evaluation Material.\n9. No Solicitation. The Recipient will not, within one year from the date of this Agreement, solicit the employment or consulting services of any of the officers of the Provider with whom it has had contact in connection with its evaluation of a Possible Transaction, so long as they are employed by the Provider. The Recipient is not prohibited from: (i) soliciting by means of a general advertisement not directed at any particular individual or the employees of the Provider generally, or (ii) engaging any recruiting firm or similar organization to identify or solicit individuals for employment on behalf of the Recipient (and soliciting any person identified by any such recruiting firm or organization) so long as the Recipient does not identify the individuals to be solicited by such recruiting firm or organization.\n10. Standstill. RHI agrees that, for a period ending on the earlier of (x) one year after the date of this Agreement, (y) the date a public announcement is made of the entry by JDA into a binding definitive agreement with any third party to effect a purchase, tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination that, if consummated, would result in a third party owning at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities of JDA or all or substantially all of the assets of JDA and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (z) the date of commencement by a third party of a tender or exchange offer for at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities of JDA (the “Standstill Period”), unless specifically invited in writing by JDA or its Representatives, neither RHI nor any of its affiliates (as such term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”)) which has been furnished with Evaluation Material pursuant hereto (including New Mountain Capital LLC) or Representatives (acting on its behalf) will in any manner, directly or indirectly:\n(a) effect, seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or cause or participate in, or in any way assist any other Person to effect, seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in:\n(i) any acquisition of the equity securities (or beneficial ownership thereof) or any material assets of JDA or any of its subsidiaries,\n(ii) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination involving JDA or any of its subsidiaries,\n(iii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to JDA or any of its subsidiaries, or\n(iv) any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents to vote any voting securities of JDA;\n(b) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (as defined under the 1934 Act with respect to the voting securities of JDA;\n(c) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit an unsolicited proposal for or offer of (with or without condition), any extraordinary transaction involving JDA or its voting securities or assets;\n(d) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to change, control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of JDA;\n(e) take any action which might force JDA to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in (a) above;\n(f) enter into any discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing; or\n(g) make any public announcement inconsistent with the agreements contained in this Section,\nRHI also agrees during the Standstill Period not to request (either directly or through its affiliates or Representatives) that JDA (or its directors, officers, employees or agents), directly or indirectly, amend or waive any provision of this Section 10 (including this sentence) if such request would require JDA to publicly disclose such request. In no event shall this Section 10 be construed as prohibiting the taking of any of the aforementioned actions with respect to any Person other than JDA or any of its subsidiaries notwithstanding the fact that, at the time such action is taken, JDA (or a subsidiary thereof) may be a subsidiary of such Person.\n11. Maintaining Privileges. If any Evaluation Material includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each Party understands and agrees that the Parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the Parties that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material provided by a Party that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.\n12. Compliance with Securities Laws. The Recipient and its Representatives agree not to use any Evaluation Material of the Provider in violation of applicable securities laws.\n13. Not a Transaction Agreement. Each Party understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for a Possible Transaction exists between the Parties unless and until a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, and each Party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) relating to the existence of a Possible Transaction unless and until both Parties shall have entered into a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction. Each Party also agrees that, unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein.\n14. No Representations or Warranties: No Obligation to Disclose. The Recipient understands and acknowledges that neither the Provider nor its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material furnished by or on behalf of the Provider and shall have no liability to the Recipient, its Representatives or any other Person relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material furnished to the Recipient or its Representatives or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. As to the information delivered to the Recipient, the Provider will only be liable for those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as obligating a Party to provide, or to continue to provide, any information to any Person.\n15. Modifications and Waiver. No provision of this Agreement can be waived or amended in favor of either Party except by written consent of the other Party, which consent shall specifically refer to such provision and explicitly make such waiver or amendment. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n16. Remedies. Each Party understands and agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by either Party or any of its Representatives and that the Party against which such breach is committed shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threat thereof without the requirement of posting a bond or other security. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by either Party of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Party against which such breach is committed. If a court of competent jurisdiction, pursuant to a final, non-appealable order, determines that the Recipient or any of its Representatives has breached this Agreement, the Recipient shall pay the reasonable costs (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Provider in enforcing this Agreement.\n17. Governing Law. This Agreement is for the benefit of each Party and its successors (including any purchaser of such Party) and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement may be enforced by any Person with which the Recipient enters into a transaction. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the State of Delaware, New Castle County, for the purpose of any action, suit or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and agree not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in any such court, and further agree that service of process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to its address set forth in this Agreement will be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each Party hereby also irrevocably and unconditionally (i) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any such federal and state courts, and (ii) waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n18. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and if a covenant or provision is determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extent, duration, scope or otherwise, then the Parties intend and hereby request that the court or other authority making that determination shall only modify such extent, duration, scope or other provision to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and enforce them in their modified form for all purposes of this Agreement.\n19. Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the authorship at any of the provisions of this Agreement.\n20. Term. This Agreement shall terminate two years after the date of this Agreement.\n21. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, arrangements and discussions between the Parties regarding such subject matter (including that certain Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement, dated November 8, 2011, between JDA Software Group, Inc. and RedPrairie Holding, Inc.).\n22.

{"prompt": "Distributor/Sales and Marketing Agency Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement\nThis Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into this ______ day of _____________, 20__, by and between _________________________________, a ___________entity, together with its operating subsidiaries and affiliates (“Distributor”) with its principal place of business at ________________________________________________, and _______________________________________, a ____________ entity, together with its operating subsidiaries and affiliates, (“Agency”) with its principal place of business at _______________________________________________ (collectively the “Parties”).\nWHEREAS, Agency serves agent to one or more suppliers/manufacturers (“Principals”) in providing agency sales and marketing services in the foodservice trade channel (“Agency Sales and Marketing Services”), and WHEREAS, in the course of the provision of Agency Sales and Marketing Services for Agency’s Principals, each party (a “Disclosing Party”) may disclose to the other party (the “Recipient”) certain Confidential Information (as such term is defined herein below), which shall be deemed to be confidential; and\nWHEREAS, the Confidential Information may be disclosed in many such form(s) including oral and/or written disclosure, disclosure through training and/or disclosure through observation of products or prototypes of products, services, business plans, business documents, materials and/or property;\nNOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto agree as follows:\n1. Definition.\n“Confidential Information” means, in respect to each Party:\n(a) any information in which such Party claims a proprietary and/or confidential interest;\n(b) all confidential matters of such Party including, without limitation, technical know-how, trade secrets, technical data, new product strategy, new products or processes, analysis, compilations, concepts, technical processes, formulae, recipes, specifications, inventions, research projects, customer lists, pricing, pricing policies, operational methods, financial information, marketing information and other business affairs;\n(c) any information of a confidential nature concerning such Party’s customers, suppliers or employees; and\n(d) any information such Party has received from others which they are obliged to treat as proprietary and/or confidential.\nThe Confidential Information of either Party includes all of the above information with respect to any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such Party.\nConfidential Information shall not include information which: (a) is in the public domain prior to the date of its disclosure to Recipient by the Disclosing Party; (b) is known and can be shown to be known by Recipient prior to the date of its disclosure to Recipient by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes part of the public domain by publication or otherwise, and is not the result of any unauthorized act or omission on the part of Recipient; (d) can be demonstrated to have been supplied to Recipient by a third party who is under no obligation to the Disclosing Party to maintain such information in confidence; or (e) is independently developed by Recipient without the use of the Confidential Information.\n2. Obligation of Confidence. Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information constitutes valuable information, and the provisions of this Agreement are necessary to protect the secrecy and confidentiality thereof.\n(a) Recipient shall (i) maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence and take all reasonable steps to prevent its disclosure to third parties; (ii) use at least the same degree of care as Recipient uses in maintaining the secrecy of its own Confidential Information (but no less than a reasonable degree of care); and (iii) prevent the removal of any proprietary, confidential or copyright notices placed on the Confidential Information.\n(b) Recipient may use the Confidential Information only in connection with the performance of the Agency Sales and Marketing Services with Distributor. Recipient shall not, at any time, make any use of the Confidential Information for any other purpose.\n(c) Recipient shall keep the Confidential Information confidential at all times and shall not disclose the Confidential Information to any person including its employees except to its employees, representatives, advisors and agents who have a need to know such information in connection with assisting Recipient for the purposes set forth in paragraph 2(b) above and who are required to keep such information confidential.\n(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 2, Recipient may disclose to Principals, on whose behalf it is performing Agency Sales and Marketing Services with Distributor, and who have a need to know the Confidential Information provided that: (i) Distributor has been notified of the identity of such Principals and has agreed to the disclosure of Confidentiality Agreement under this Section 2(d), (ii) only the necessary portions of Confidential Information required by such Principals to evaluate and utilize the Agency Sales and Marketing Services is disclosed, and (iii) Principal has a Confidentiality Agreement in place with Distributor or has a Confidentiality Agreement acceptable to Distributor in place with Recipient.\n3. Return of Materials and Information. All Documents made available hereunder, including all copies, notes, summaries, and abstracts thereof, shall be returned to the Disclosing Party or destroyed upon completion of the Agency Sales and Marketing Services with Distributor or upon written request by the Disclosing Party, and Recipient shall certify in writing that it has complied with the provisions of this Agreement.\n4. Opportunity to Seek Protective Order. In the event Recipient is requested or required by applicable law, regulation or legal process (including a subpoena or other administrative or judicial request), to disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, Recipient shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party so that it may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. Unless the demand shall have been timely limited, quashed or extended, Recipient shall thereafter be entitled to comply with such demand to the extent required by law. If requested by the Disclosing Party, Recipient shall provide reasonable cooperation (at the expense of the Disclosing Party) in the defense of a demand to disclose Confidential Information.\n5. Patent, Copyright or Trademark Infringement. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any new or additional rights under any patent, copyright or trademark, nor shall this Agreement grant the Parties any new or additional rights in or to the Confidential Information, except the limited right to review and use such Confidential Information for the purpose outlined herein.\n6. Ownership. As between the Parties, all Confidential Information shall remain the property of the FSMA\nDisclosing Party.

Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require Parties to share any Confidential Information with the other, and the Disclosing Party makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information disclosed hereunder.\n7. Injunctive Relief. It is understood and agreed that damages are an inadequate remedy in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach by any Party under this Agreement and that any such breach by any party will cause irreparable harm, injury and damage; accordingly, the Parties agree that the damaged party may be entitled, without waiving any additional rights or remedies (including monetary damages) otherwise available to it at law, or in equity, or by statute, to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach by any Party.\n8. Survival. The foregoing obligations of all Parties shall continue for a period of two (2) years from the date of last disclosure of Confidential Information by either party, unless a specific portion of the Confidential Information disclosed becomes generally known to the public before the expiration of such two (2) year period through no fault of the Receiving Party. However, with respect to trade secrets, such obligations will survive for so long as such Confidential Information constitutes a trade secret under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.\n9. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF THE PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS OF DISTRIBUTOR AS SET FORTH IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH ABOVE (REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW) AS TO ALL MATTERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MATTERS OF VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, EFFECT, PERFORMANCE AND REMEDY. The county in which the principal place of business of Distributor is located as set forth in the first paragraph above and the closest state or federal court to the principal place of business of Agency shall each be a proper (but not exclusive) place of venue for any suits to enforce this Agreement, and any legal proceedings to enforce the provisions hereof may be brought in the state or federal Court sitting in such county or the closest state or federal court to the principal place of business of Agency. Each Party hereby further irrevocably waives any claim that any such court lacks jurisdiction over it, and agrees not to plead or claim, in any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement brought in any of the aforesaid courts, that any such court lacks jurisdiction over it or that such court is located in an inconvenient forum.\n10. Miscellaneous. This Agreement constitutes the final, complete and exclusive agreement between the Parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, written or oral, between the Parties with respect thereto. Any modification, rescission or amendment of this Agreement shall not be effective unless made in a writing executed by both Parties. In case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision(s) had never been contained herein, provided that such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision(s) shall first be curtailed, reformed, limited or eliminated to the extent necessary to remove such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability with respect to the applicable law as it shall then be applied. Any waiver of, or promise not to enforce, any right under this Agreement shall not be enforceable unless evidenced by a writing signed by the party making said waiver or promise.

It is further agreed by you that an order of specific performance or for injunctive relief against you in the event of a breach or default under the terms of this Agreement would be equitable and would not work a hardship on you. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or default by you hereunder, the Seller, without any bond or other security being required and in addition to whatever other remedies are or might be available at law or in equity, shall have the right either to compel specific performance by, or to obtain injunctive relief against you, with respect to any obligation or duty herein or breach thereof.
