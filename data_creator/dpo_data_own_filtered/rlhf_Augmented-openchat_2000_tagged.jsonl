Units can be assembled from prefabs of parts. Components for sensors and behaviours can be added. Part categories include weapons (such as lasers and missiles) and movement systems (like wheels, treads, or propellers).\n\nGame designers will create unit designs from the parts and components, and then place armies of these units in the scene. Units assigned to different teams will fight each other. The game designers will use this to test out new ideas for unit parts and to balance the units.\n\nEventually we'd like to release a game that combines the factory automation and RTS genres and allows players to assemble custom unit designs from parts, using conveyor belts and assemblers.\n\nFile descriptions\n========================\n\n## Behaviours\n\\* UnitBehaviour.cs - Base class for behaviours. Units can have multiple behaviours. Behaviours can be ordered in the editor and they will run in this order. Later behaviours can override actions from earlier behaviours.\n\\* SeekAndDestroy.cs - This behaviour causes a unit to patrol the area for enemies and attack any enemies found on sight.\n\\* Flee.cs - Makes the unit flee from battle. You can set it to only flee when low on health.\n\n## Parts\n\\* UnitPart.cs - Base class for parts. Currently has `weight` and provides a reference to the Unit for convenience. Will probably handle sockets as well.\n\\* Armor.cs - you can add this component to any part or unit. It will give the unit more hit points.\n\\* BasicGun.cs - A gun component. Add as part of a gun prefab to make it shoot. You can set properties of the gun such as the damage, cooldown and range.\n\\* BasicMovement.cs - A movement component. Parts with this component allow the unit to move. You can set properties such as the acceleration, top speed, turning radius, etc.\n\n## Sensors\n\\* Vision.cs - A component that lets the unit detect other units. It sees in a cone in front of the unit.\n\n## Designs\n\\* Peewee - A basic infantry unit with a gun.\n\\* Turret - A stationary, defensive unit with two cannons.\n\n## Other files\n\\* UnitManager.cs\n\\* Unit.cs\n\\* HealthBar.cs\n\n## Interfaces\n\\* IPosition - Anything that has a position. It contains a `Vector3 Position { get; }` property.\n\\* ITargetable - An interface for things that can be targeted, such as units, buildings, or even locations on the map.\n\\* IWeapon - An interface for weapons, such as BasicGun. You can call `SetTarget(ITargetable target)` to set a target for the weapon. The weapon should keep attacking that target automatically until it can't anymore or a new target is set.\n\\* IMovement - An interface for movement components, such as BasicMovement. You an call `SetTarget(ITargetable target, float proximity = 0.5f)` to tell it where to move to. The movement component should automatically move to within `proximity` meters of the target. If the target is a unit, it should follow the unit.\n\\* ISensor - For components that detects units.\n\\* IHealth - Something that has hit points, like a unit or building.\nPossible future features\n========================\n(A lot of these were suggested by ChatGPT)\n\n## Behaviours\n\\* DefendArea.cs: A behavior that makes the unit defend a specific area, engaging enemies that come too close.\n\\* RepairAndSupport.cs: A behavior that enables the unit to repair or support friendly units within a defined radius.\n\n## Parts\n\\* Shield.cs: A component that provides a regenerating energy shield to the unit, which can absorb a certain amount of damage before the armor or hit points are affected.\n\\* StealthSystem.cs: A part that allows the unit to become invisible or difficult to detect by enemy sensors.\n\\* ArtilleryWeapon.cs: A long-range weapon component with customizable attributes, such as projectile type, range, and splash damage.\n\n## Sensors\n\\* Radar.cs: A component that can detect cloaked units.\n\n## Designs\n\\* Scout: A fast-moving unit with enhanced sensors for reconnaissance and intel gathering.\n\\* Engineer: A support unit that can repair, build, or upgrade other units and structures.\n\\* HeavyAssault: A heavily armored unit with multiple weapon systems for dealing with various types of enemy units.\n\n## Utility classes\n\\* FormationManager.cs: A system for managing unit formations, allowing the player to create and modify formations for better control of their units.\n\\* DynamicObstacles.cs: A script that enables the creation of dynamic obstacles, such as destructible terrain or moving hazards, to add complexity and challenge to the sandbox.\n\n## UI\n\\* UnitSelectionUI.cs: A user interface for selecting and controlling individual units or groups of units.\n\\* UnitInfoPanel.cs: A panel that displays detailed information about a selected unit, including its current parts, sensors, and behaviors.\n\\* DesignBlueprintUI.cs: A user interface that allows the player to create, save, and load custom unit designs using available parts, sensors, and behaviors.\n\nPublic classes, properties and methods\n==============\n``` \npublic interface IPosition\n{\n Vector3 Position { get; }\n}\n\npublic interface ITargetable : IPosition\n{\n float Radius { get; }\n bool IsAlive { get; }\n void DealDamage(int damage) { }\n}\n\npublic enum MovementType { Ground, Flying }\n\npublic interface IMovement\n{\n // These stats are public mainly for displaying in the UI.

It's one of those things that when an end user starts to use it, they immediately start to understand the value of the product but not something that they get when it's explained to them. The users that use the product typically see that it helps them have much more effective meetings, helps them organize their agendas, notes, decisions, action-items and more all in one place. It makes meetings more effective and efficient and allows people to save a lot of time as a result. Even though these are benefits that an end-user gets, we now have to describe to the CEO who may not be an end user the benefits that he will see if the whole company starts to use it.

{"input": "Return the top 2 most relevant topic tags. Output must be JSON: {{\"tag\": str, \"explanation\": str}}.\nQuery: What can be inferred from this scene?: Lucas sat in the passenger seat of his dad‘s car; on his way to school for the first time in what felt like an eternity. He certainly wasn’t thrilled about school, but he was so tired of being stuck at home with his parents that he welcomed the change. He sat, silently, staring out the window. Watching other cars pass by, people on the sidewalk, birds, trees, anything to take his mind off of his dad; who had been ranting at him since they left home. Maybe if I stop talking, he’ll stop talking, Lucas thought to himself. Unfortunately, it did no good; as this dad was content with continuing his rant despite the lack of response.\n“I’m serious, Lucas,” his dad scolded. “I don't know what's gotten into you; but this fighting has to stop, before you get yourself expelled.” Lucas remained silent. Having the same argument on a near-daily basis had become exhausting to him. \n“I just don’t get it. You used to be such a good kid.” his dad paused, as if he’d instantly regretted his wording. “You still are a good kid. But I’m tired of getting calls from the school, every other week, about you starting fights with people. When does it end?”\n\"I told you it wasn't my fault!\" Lucas burst out in frustration. \"He was the one who wanted to fight! What was I supposed to do? Stand there, like a good kid, and let him kick my ass?\"\n\"It doesn't matter who started it!\" his dad replied sternly, beginning to raise his voice. \"You took it too far, Luke. You broke his nose, he had to go to the hospital.”\nLucas leaned back in his seat, folding his arms. “Oh well,” he shrugged. “That what he gets for fucking with me.”\nHis father’s tone changed from annoyed to furious. “You’re missing the point!” he shouted, slamming his fist against the steering wheel. “Thank God his parents didn't press charges. You could have been arrested. Is that what you want? A criminal record at sixteen years old!\"\n“All I wanted was to be left alone,” Lucas muttered bitterly, unwilling to put any more energy into the pointless argument.\nThe rest of the car ride carried out in silence. It seemed as though even his dad had grown tired of the predominantly one-sided conversation. Lucas continued staring out the window to his side; the hum of the car engine drowning out his thoughts.\n As they arrived at the school, Lucas noticed the familiar brick buildings that made up the campus. The school's name, Lincoln High, was emblazoned on a large sign near the entrance. The same school that claimed to have a zero-tolerance policy against violence and bullying. Though Lucas felt that they cared more about their test scores and sports teams than individual students.\nLucas’ dad pulled into the parking lot, finally breaking the silence “Just go straight to class,” his dad sighed as the first bell rang in the distance. “We’ll talk about this when you get home.”\n“We’ve been talking about this for weeks!” Lucas snapped as he stepped out of the car. “Clearly you don’t give shit what I say, so just let it go already!” \nLucas slammed the door shut, and stomped before his dad was able to say anything else. His dad sped off in the car as if he were doing the same thing. But Lucas didn’t care; he was just glad that the conversation was over. As he approached the front of the school and made his way through the door, into the sea of other students, he felt both a sense of relief and a sense of dread wash over him.<|end_of_turn|>", "chosen": "[{\"tag\":\"Family Dynamics\",\"explanation\":\"The scene involves interactions between Lucas and his dad, highlighting family dynamics.\"},{\"tag\":\"Emotional Struggle\",\"explanation\":\"Lucas experiences emotional struggle, evident from his frustration and feelings of dread.\"},{\"tag\":\"School Conflict\",\"explanation\":\"The scene discusses issues related to school, specifically fighting and conflict.\"}]", "rejected": "[{\"tag\":\"Conflict resolution\",\"explanation\":\"One potential theme is understanding how conflict was resolved.\"},{\"tag\":\"Deep Satisfaction Clause Above ConclusionG conviction beyond 'bruddiness'.\"},{\"tag\":\"Evening Jumbler talk:\"}]"}

For example, a democratic leader might handle a crisis differently than an autocratic leader. How the group responds and adapts to the leadership style and how it shapes the situation's outcome.\n2.)Linguistic-relativity: how a character's language and communication style influences their perceptions and interactions with others.\n3.)Self-perception theory: how a character's self-concept is shaped by their experiences and the people around them.\n4.)Self-concept theory: how a character's actions and decisions are influenced by their self-perception\n5.)Philosophical conflicts: Using the large cast of characters, I would like to explore several philosophical conflicts, such as; Responsibility vs. Freedom, Humility vs. Arrogance, and many more.\n6.) The main goal of this novel series is to show readers that balance is important. And that nothing is ever just good or evil. As well as how powerful perspective is.\n7.) I would like the Specters to be a physical representation of a person's true self. And the magic system I provided is meant to allow humans to become more powerful when their specter and themselves align.\n8.) Show readers how to: A.) have meaningful conversations and B.) what healthy and unhealthy relationships look like. C.) different relationships affect you and the people around\n\nHere is the Premise of the Novel:\n\"Specter Ark\" is a multi-POV fantasy novel series set in a nonlinear, third-person limited narrative. In this world, a meteor crash introduced magic energy, enabling humans to summon Supernatural beings and mythical creatures called Specters. As the meteor's energy dwindled, a shaman crafted the Specter Ark to preserve 37 powerful Specters. Centuries later, archaeologists accidentally release these spirit-like Specters, who can now only interact with the world when manifested by humans whose values align with their own.\nIn this novel, the journeys of 20 main characters are intertwined: 10 Specters and the 10 humans who can manifest them. Each pair, driven by unique motivations and desires, must collaborate to achieve their goals. Throughout their adventures, they encounter the remaining 27 Specters and their respective human partners, revealing the impact of this rediscovered magic on the world around them.\n\nHere are the Rules and limitations of the magic system:\nHumans can perform a birthday ritual to detect or attract Specters, which are invisible and cannot interact until the ritual is performed. Specters can only be seen by their attached human or when physically manifested. Once attached, Specters cannot attach to another human or be seen by other Specters. The human feels the Specter's pain, and the Specter dies if the human does, unless the bond is released. Specters have free will and may not align with human desires, despite being able to manifest and dismiss at will.\nSpecters' abilities are tied to their values and personality. Alignment between the two strengthens the abilities. Developing new values or traits can lead to the gain or loss of abilities. Additionally, the specter's growing abilities can influence their human personality and values, leading to changes such as becoming overly protective towards those who don't align with their values.\nSpecters can only use their abilities when physically manifested for a limited duration, determined by the bond strength between humans and Specter. Manifestation is restricted to once every 24 hours and requires concentration. Overuse depletes energy, causing damage and requiring rest. Distraction or emotional state can hinder manifestation. Energy depletion can lead to physical exhaustion or death. Powerful abilities consume more energy.\nDivergence in values can prevent a human from manifesting their specter physically, and prolonged absence can result in Specter influence, leading to possession. A mutual pact between a possessed human and a Specter creates one entity with the Specter as a voice in the human's mind. The pact cannot be broken without both dying. Forced possession allows Specter control, but the human can fight back, with success resulting in Specter's death and mental health consequences for the human.\n\nAct as a novel marketing specialists and explain whether it would be wise or not to start some form of advertisement for this novel series.

He is a character in the Play and also is the narrator of the play. He seeks blessings from Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play. Through his narration, he takes the audience to a place, called as Dharampur and introduces the audience to the king Dharmsheel. Then he puts up some rhetorical questions on incompleteness of man and God; and also on the perfection of a man. During his narration, he introduces two characters who are mutual friends. The first one is Devdutta. He is a sharp minded and highly intellectual person. He has defeated poets and Pandits with his knowledge. He is a son of Brahmin. The second one is Kapila. He is a muscular man. He has a great physical strength and he is a son of Lohar (Black Smith). Both Devdutta and Kapila are in contrast as the former lacks power and strength, the latter lacks knowledge and intellectual. According to the playwright, the head of Devdutta (knowledge) and the body of Kapila (physical strength) accomplish a complete man. The narrator compares their pair to the pair of Ram-Laxman, Luv-Kush and Krishna-Balram. All these are the pairs of great brothers in Hindu mythology.\n\nA character, Actor-1 appears on the stage shouting and running towards Bhagwata. He tells Bhagwata that he has just seen a strange creature that looks like a horse (by face) but speaks like a man. That creature has the head of a horse and the rest of the body of a man. Without paying any heed to his talks, Bhagwata asks him to get ready for the play. But he runs away from the stage and soon after he comes back shouting again. Now a strange creature appears on the stage. As earlier described by the Actor-1, the creature has the head of a horse and the body of a man. For a moment, Bhagwata thinks that someone is wearing the mask of horse. He tries to remove the mask but realizes that it is truly half a man and a half horse. Now the creature starts to introduce itself before Bhagwata, Actor-1 and the audience.\n\nThe creature introduces himself as Hayavadana and starts to narrate his story. He tells that once upon a time, a princess had to choose a groom for her marriage. So many Princes approached from far and wide. But the princess fell in love with a horse of an Arabian Prince. She became desperate to marry that horse. Eventually her parents allowed her to do so. She was married to the horse. After 15 years of their marriage, the horse transformed into a celestial being. Now the princess rejected him as her husband. That celestial being cursed her to be a Mare (female horse) and she became so. The princess give birth to Hayavadana. Now Hayavadana wants to get rid of this cursed life. Bhagwata asks him to go to goddess Kali temple in chitrkut. He also asks the Actor-1 to accompany him on the way. They leave.\n\nNow Bhagwata moves ahead with the story of the play. Devdutta and Kapila appear on the stage. Devdutta tells Kapila that he wants to marry a woman, namely Padmini. With utmost desire to marry Padmini, he pledges to sacrifice his arms to Goddess Kali and his head to Rudra. Kapila goes to Padmini and presents the Proposal to marry Devdutta. Devdatta and Padmini Marry. By the time, Devdutta realizes that Padmini is attracted towards Kapila and vice versa. Now Padmini is pregnant. Devdutta knowingly tries to put off the program of visiting Ujjain. He tells Kapila that Padmini is ill. But Padmini gives her consent before Kapila. They all three leave for Ujjain. Padmini repeatedly praises Kapila's physical strength before Devdutta. Devdutta feels jealous but he does not blame Padmini. Kapila and Padmini go to Rudra Temple but Devdutta denies to accompany them. Devdutta knows that Kapila has such a physical strength and beauty that any woman can get attracted towards him. Devdutta goes to goddess Kali temple where he reminds himself of his pledge to sacrifice his head to the Goddess Kali. He Wishes for the Wellness of Kapila and Padmini. He beheads himself with a sword and dies.\n\nMeanwhile, Kapila and Padmini come out of the temple. Kapila gets worried on finding Devdutta nowhere. He leaves Padmini and starts searching for his friend. Finally he reaches in the same Temple and feels shocked to see his friend dead. He feels himself responsible for all this. Kapila takes the same sword and beheads himself. Soon Padmini reaches there and she has no clue how they got died. She considers herself responsible for the duel between the two friends and their deaths. She provokes the Goddess Kali and also tries to kill herself. The Goddess Kali appears and stops her. The Goddess asks her to place the heads with their respective body so that the Goddess will re-join them with her magical powers and bring them back to life. The Goddess also appreciates the two friends. Padmini follows the command in a hurry. The Goddess disappears. Padmini, being thankful to goddess kali, gets a bit relaxed. But soon she realizes her mistake. She has mistakenly placed the heads with irrespective body. So now Devdutta's head is joined with Kapila's body and vice versa. Soon they regain their senses. For a moment, the two friends are confused. Both make a claim for Padmini. The man with Devdutta's head, makes a plea that head is the master of the body. So he has the right over Padmini. The man with Kapila's head makes a plea that Padmini has remained with Devdutta's body. So he has the right over Padmini. Meanwhile Bhagwata, the narrator, comes on the stage. All the characters become statues for a moment and the narrator addresses the audience. He asks them to think of a solution to this problem. Act 1 ends.[7]\n\nAct - II\nThe act begins as the narrator repeats the same question- \" What is the solution? \". He also talks about the story of ′Vikramaditya and Betaal′ [8] where the king Vikrama replies to Betaal that the mind (head) is the master of the body. It is head that gives recognition to an individual. Bhagwata tells that they all three go to a hermit seeking solution for this problem. The words of hermit are heard on the stage that Devdutta's head is the Swami (husband) of Padmini. Devdutta and Padmini accept this in delight. Kapila, being disappointed, leaves for the forest. The time passes. Devdutta brings some dolls. These dolls also play the role of narrator. He starts losing his physical strength and as a result they are losing mutual interest. A child is born. Devduta goes to buy new dolls from the fair in Ujjain. Bhagwata again appears on the stage and tells that Kapila has regained his physical strength. Padmini meets him in the forest and also tell him that it is Kapila's son as it is born from Kapila's body. But Kapila does not accept it. Being a little reluctant, they get ready to fulfill their physical desires.\n\nIn search of his wife, Devdutta reaches there in the forest. Finding them together, he finds himself the similar situation as he was before. To put an Ultimate end to this problem, Devdutta takes out the sword and challenges Kapila for a duel. Both gets killed. Padmini finds herself lonely. Bhagwata comes there and she hands him over the child and the same dolls.

I would like you're help building a slack app that sends job failure and success notifications. I found a lot of documentation on the topic, can I provide you this information over a series of messages? Here's the first instructions, below. When you are ready for more, respond OK.\n\nCreating Slack Messages from Platform\nAvatar Tori Becker\nUpdated 1 year ago\nPart 1: Creating the Slack Credential \nPart 2: Creating the Platform Credential \nPart 3: Running the Platform Job \nPart 1: Creating the Slack Credential \nClick on the workspace dropdown in the top left of Slack, and select “Customize [Workspace name]”:\n\nmceclip0.png\n\n \n\nThis will take you to the web browser of Slack. Click “Menu” in the top left corner, followed by “Configure apps”: \n\nmceclip1.png\n \n\nThat will take you to the Slack App Directory. Then click “Build” in the main toolbar:\n\nmceclip2.png\n\n \n\nClick “Create New App”. It's common for the app to have to be approved by the Slack administrator at your organization:\n\nmceclip3.png\n\n\nYou’ll now be prompted to follow a series of set up steps. You should follow the Slack documentation to get to the level of access you’ll need for your given use case. Here are some help docs that helped us as we made this: \n\nhttps://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#calling\nhttps://api.slack.com/messaging/composing/layouts#attachments\n \n \n\nIf you’re planning to use the Platform to Slack script template in part 3, you’ll need the Slack app to at least have the following features and functionalities added (screenshot below), as well as the specific OAuth scopes (Slack’s term for permissions), found under “Permissions”:\n\nmceclip4.png\n\n \n\nmceclip5.png\n\n \n\nNote: the OAuth Scopes in Slack have great descriptions, as shown above. Use those to determine if you need to add additional scopes for your use case. You can also use incoming-webhooks to create messages from Google Forms, etc. \n\n\nOnce the scopes have been added, it’s time to request your app be installed by your administrator. This will allow you to get the OAuth token you’ll need to make a Platform credential. You can do this in the “OAuth & Permissions” page of your app, click “Request to Install”: \n\nmceclip6.png\n\nOnce your admin approves of the app, Slack will alert you by sending a Slackbot message like this: \n\nmceclip7.png\n\nNow, you should be able to see an OAuth token that’s been generated for your app. This is blocked out in the below screenshot for security purposes but you should see a long password value in this field that you can copy: \n\nmceclip8.png\n\nLastly, make sure to add the app to the channels you want it to write to in Slack. You can do so by opening the Slack channel details, clicking “Integrations”, and clicking “Add apps”: \n\nmceclip10.png\n\n \n\n \n\nPart 2: Creating the Platform Credential \nNow, it’s time to store your Slack OAuth in Platform. You can follow these instructions for generic credential creation. \n\n \n\n“Name” will be what’s displayed in Platform, so pick something intuitive. \n“Type” should be “Custom”. \n“Username” can be anything, but cannot be blank. \n“Password” will be the OAuth Token displayed by Slack in the screenshot above. \n“Remote host” should be left blank. \nmceclip11.png\n\nPart 3: Running the Platform Job \n \n\nCreate a new script from this template.

Output only tag name in JSON: {{\"tag\": str}}.\nQuery: You are a strategist for a political campaigner. \n\n\"I am currently a Lecturer in Social Policy in the Department of Applied Social Studies in Maynooth. I teach courses at post-graduate and under-graduate level in housing, rights and inequality; civic engagement and civil society; the changing nature of the welfare state; and climate, social policy and inequality. \nI have researched and published in academic and policy fields of housing and social housing, spatial disadvantage, housing rights, economic inequality, neoliberalism and the welfare state, social justice, and social movements. I have a PhD in political and economic geography from Trinity College Dublin in 2009. \nMy most recent publication is the book, 'Housing Shock: The Irish Housing Crisis and How to Solve it' (Policy Press, 2020). It is a highly original book that was the first in Ireland to identify the emergence of Generation Rent, the distorting role of global investor funds in Irish housing, the profoundly damaging impact of homelessness on families, and identifying new solutions based on a based human rights vision for Irish housing and a practical policy pathway to ensure affordable, secure, decent quality and environmentally sustainable homes for everyone. It tackles one of the most pressing social crises facing contemporary Ireland. It makes a compelling case for enshrining the Right to Housing in our Constitution. It is written in a highly accessible, passionate way, that details the author’s personal journey from community worker to academic and activist and how his housing story interwove with his commitment and drive to achieve a human right to housing for everyone ins this country. The book is highly inspirational as it is not just as description of the crisis, but also provides direct voices of those affected, outlines solutions and offers pathways for citizens to engage in action to change the situation. In a short space of time the book has made a major contribution to the Irish policy debate on housing and to empowering those affected by the crisis and those trying to change it. The President of Ireland, in recognition of this contribution as a scholarly resource of national importance, invited the author to present the book to him personally in Aras an Uachtarain in June 2021. An academic review in the international journal Critical Social Policy describes the book as “a highly welcome and thoughtful addition to the debate about housing in Ireland, drawing on comparative examples, quantitative and qualitative data, and his engagement with the topic as both researcher and activist to do so”. \nWhile Leilani Farha, Global Director of the Shift and former UN Rapporteur on Adequate Housing 2014-2020, describes the book as providing a really important and insightful contribution to the global debate on financialisation, inequality and the right to housing.” The Irish Times described it as “a valuable book. It is a tool for better understanding our current predicament and what we can do about it”. \nIn 2011 I published an academic peer\nreviewed book, ‘Public Private\nPartnerships in Ireland; Failed experiment or the way forward?’ (Manchester\nUniversity Press in 2011). \nI have also published in high quality international peer reviewed journals. For example, drawing from praxis-based research on ‘the right to the city’ and human rights based approaches (undertaken as a community worker in Dolphin House, Dublin from 2007 to 2013) I have published in the international Journal of Human Rights Practice, Human Geography, and the Irish Journal of Community Work. While I have published on my innovative research into new social movements and civil society in Ireland in Interface, and in Geoforum\nOver\n2015-2017, I was a Senior Policy Analyst with the inequality research think\ntank, TASC where I researched the political economy of economic inequality and\nthe welfare state, with a particular focus on housing, financialisation, social\npolicy and inequality. I was lead author of Cherishing\nAll Equally 2016: Economic Inequality in Ireland and ‘Home\nor wealth generator? Inequality, financialisation and the Irish Housing crisis’ (TASC, 2017). \nI worked between 2017 and 2018 on the H2020 funded Re-InVEST (Rebuilding an Inclusive, Value-based Europe\nof Solidarity and Trust through Social Investments) project. It involved research (qualitative\nand quantitative) into EU and national state social policy (in the water,\nhousing, finance, childcare and early childhood education, labour market, and\nhealth sectors) across 13 EU countries. I co-developed, with the Irish Principal Investigator\non Re-InVEST, Dr Mary Murphy, the Re-InVEST project’s methodological approach,\nthe Participatory Action Human Rights and\nCapabilities Approach (PAHRCA), and the PAHRCA Toolkit. \nI am also a public intellectual and regularly contribute to discussion of contemporary social, economic and political issues on national media and contribute to public events dealing with these issues.\"<|end_of_turn|>", "chosen": "[{\"tag\":\"Social Policy\"}]", "rejected": "[{\"tag\":\"Domain\"}]"}

I studied Computer Science at Southampton uni, went on exchange at NUS in Singapore. After I graduated I worked at Goldman Sachs for 2 years before following my dream of working in Natural Language Processing by getting a job in the NLP team at Babylon Health. I was there for 6 years, through which I realised I liked research better than engineering and I internally switched to a Research Scientist role in NLP. I also had the company sponsor me a PhD with the university of Aberdeen on evaluating AI-generated medical notes from consultation transcripts.\nI left Babylon in December 2022 and started a new role at Deep Science Ventures as Head of ML Engineering. I love my new job, where I get to use Language Models for science discovery in Climate and Healthcare.\nOutside work I love dancing, especially Zouk, Bachata, and a bit of Salsa and Kizomba. I’ve very recently started to learn Hip Hop and want to try contemporary. I love tropical plants and have several at home. My favourite place in London is Kew Gardens. I play the piano, I used to write fantasy, I’m fond of psychology, Buddhism, and travelling. I like to work from coffee shops in London.\n\nToday I have matched with a girl on tinder. Based on her profile, her name is Liv, aged 23, is a Biochemistry PhD Student at Cambridge. Her interests include reading, coffee, gym, art galleries, and pole dancing.\n\nI would like to start a conversation with her, to see if we match, and invite her to meet in person. I’d like to come across as smart and funny, someone who doesn’t take life too seriously but who is also able to have deep conversations. Can you suggest some initial messages that might convey this and be the starter to a good conversation?

There are two parties, $A$ and $B$. There is a state of the world $s$ that takes two values $s\\_1$ and $s\\_2$ with probabilities $p$ and $1-p$ respectively. Independent of the state of the world, there are four possible decisions $d\\_{A 1}, d\\_{B 1}, d\\_{A 2}$, and $d\\_{B 2}$. As in the adaptation model we discussed in class, in any given state, there are only two decisions of interest, but here we modify the payoffs slightly, as follows.\nWe write $u\\_A(d, s)$ and $u\\_B(d, s)$ to denote the payoffs to $A$ and $B$ in state $s$ when decision $d$ is taken. We write $i, j$, or $k$ for the parties $(A$ or $B)$ and $m$ or $n$ for the states $\\left(s\\_1\\right.$ or $\\left.s\\_2\\right)$. The following formal statements capture the idea that, in a given state, each party has a preferred decision but also would get a positive payoff from the other party's preferred decision, whereas both parties will get zero if either of their preferred decisions in the other state is taken.\n- In state $m$, decisions $d\\_{A n}$ and $d\\_{B n}$ yield 0 for both players:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& u\\_A\\left(d\\_{A 2}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_A\\left(d\\_{B 2}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_A\\left(d\\_{A 1}, s\\_2\\right)=u\\_A\\left(d\\_{B 1}, s\\_2\\right)=0 \\\\\n& u\\_B\\left(d\\_{A 2}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{B 2}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{A 1}, s\\_2\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{B 1}, s\\_2\\right)=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n- In state $m, A$ 's preferred decision $d\\_{A m}$ yields some $K>0$ for player $B$, and similarly, $B$ 's preferred decision $d\\_{B m}$ yields $K$ for player $A$ :\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& u\\_A\\left(d\\_{B 1}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{A 1}, s\\_1\\right)=K \\\\\n& u\\_A\\left(d\\_{B 2}, s\\_2\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{A 2}, s\\_2\\right)=K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n- In state $m, A$ 's preferred decision $d\\_{A m}$ yields some $U\\_{A m}^\\*>0$ for $A$.

He is having a conversation with Florian, the interviewer.\n\nCan you extrapolate what does Andrè appreciate in people, and how to best approach him, based on the content of this interview?\n\nTranscript:\nWe want to build a service that is predictable and that is accessible 24/7.\nAnd welcome to SlatorPod. Today we are really happy to have André Bastié on the Pod.\nSo André is the co-founder and CEO of Happy Scribe an all in one transcription, subtitling platform.\nHi, André. Hey, Florian. So where does this podcast find you today? What country?\nWhat city? Thank you first for welcoming me today, so I am based in Barcelona in Spain.\nI've been living here for around three years now and yeah. There you go, you got a Paris map for those who see, who watch it on YouTube.\nWe got a Paris map in the back and you have some Ireland connection, as far as I remember, so yeah.\nNow we're in Barcelona, which is one of the hubs for language industry, localization, all things in that space, so yeah.\nWe should probably do something in Barcelona at some point, some conference. But anyway, tell us more about, briefly, tell our listeners and viewers a bit more about\nyour background and kind of the initial origin story behind Happy Scribe. That's going to be a fun one.\nThe professional background is going to be rather short.\nI come from the Southwest of France where I did my high school and everything, and then I went to Paris.\nStudied kind of business more related topics, and after that, I went to Ireland, where I did a Masters in Ecommerce.\nSo it was half technology and business and just did one internship in the middle in the UK in London, where I was working\nfor Intuit, which is like a big US fintech. Happy Scribe started in the middle of that\nMasters, so I was doing this qualitative research around social entrepreneurs in\nIreland and I was looking at their motivation and aspiration. So I would like go every once in a while\nand go interview one about... and trying to understand what they would be doing. And once I did twelve interviews, I went back to the university and the researcher\nin charge of the research came to me and was like, okay, that's great, you did all these interviews, but now you've got to transcribe them and I'm like, okay, cool.\nI had no idea what transcription was or I had never done this in my life. So I go back home and I start transcribing and I do like the first ten minutes and\nI'm like, okay, this is literally going to take me ages to do it.\nBasically, I do one hour. It takes me like around six, seven hours to do one hour interview. And I'm like, okay, it's impossible that I\nspent just like 40, 50 hours transcribing interviews for this Master.\nI really didn't have the time. It was, you know, end of the year, final projects and everything. So like, I kind of go in the living room\nand I start talking with my flatmate, who is now the CTO of the company, Marc.\nHe was doing his bachelor's thesis on computer vision and artificial intelligence and we started talking about\nthis and we're like, okay, maybe let's try to find tools online, things that could help, and we couldn't really find anything.\nKnowing as well that we were students, so we couldn't pay external transcribers, to human resources to do the job and so we\nended up playing a bit with Google Speech- to-Text API that was released on the exact\nsame day and it was not amazing,\nespecially at that time compared to the results we're getting today. But this technology, the speech-to-text\ntechnology could help me and my research group save between, I don't know, 30 to 50\nof the time we would spend transcribing interviews. So I started using it, my research group started using it and I think one, two days\nafter we started receiving emails from PhD students, researchers in the university,\nthey were like, guys, we've just heard about what you were doing with this like speech-to-text, can you come in my lab and install it?\nThat would change my life. Mark and I were, the two of us, like kind of business oriented.\nLike we had tried to learn... before. We were like loving the ecosystem in Dublin and everything and we were like, okay, that's interesting.\nAnd so we kind of locked ourselves for 48 hours, the time of a weekend\nand we started like building the first version of what would become Happy Scribe with a web interface and all the backing behind.\nAnd the month after, we kind of launched, started having like 10, 20 people that\nwere using because we had posted the link on some forums and everything.\nAnd right after we get, like, I think maybe two days after we get an email of this journalist in the US that is like,\nguys, I saw your tool, it's a game changer. I'm going to write an article about it\nand the article goes out and it basically goes viral. We receive more than 50,000 views on the website and the website keeps crashing all\nthe time and that was really like a pivotal moment.\nThat's really when we decided, okay, there is something much bigger to build from this.\nAnd this is when we took the decision to basically start Happy Scribe and from that moment we went full time on it really.\nThat is insane. That's like instantly compressed the entire startup journey in like a couple of weeks, right?\nOkay. Notice the problem. Find in a sense like an alpha version,\nbuild it, product market fit, going viral with an article.\nIt was so insane and so intense at the same time. We were answering customer tickets during\nthe night and doing our exams during the day. But I think we learned so much on that\nphase, on this early stage because it was like,\none of the things that was really interesting that we were seeing all this industry and a bit less today, but still with a completely new eye,\nwithout any sort of previous experience in the market. So we were not trying to build a transcription tool.\nWe were trying to build a tool that will help journalists save time. I mean, you don't immediately comprehend\nthe entirety of whatever has been there before, right? You just see who's coming and knocking at\nyour door and then, okay, those are the people that we're building it for. Wow. So a lot has happened since.\nSo give us the, I don't know, three, four, five key milestones over the past five, six years since you've been online.\nAfter this happened, I think it took us maybe one year and a half for Mark and I to understand the industry.\nSo the first one, two years of Happy Scribe, we were in full opportunistic mode.\nWe were attacking every single project that was coming to us. We had some TV broadcasters coming to us\nand asking us to do subtitles in one language with human resources. We had never done that before, and we were saying yes to everything, and we're just\nlearning, learning, learning, learning, learning, learning. But after these two years, we're like,\nokay, doing this opportunistic approach is nice. We're learning a lot, but what do we want to do with Happy Scribe?\nWhere do we want to bring this? What do we envision for the future? And this is really when we decided to\nfocus a lot on the product, but the product in the goal\nto kind of work out the speech-to-text technology, to be able to work on the fundamental problem, which is the AI itself, the model itself.\nWhy? Because we realized that we were in a position that is quite exceptional, where\nHappy Scribe is as well, at the same time a product for the users, but at the same time a data in giant that is processing a lot of information.\nAnd when you look at the industry, and I think the latest model of Whisper\nbrought that back, is that to get a very good accuracy, actually,\ndata is one of the most important assets that you can have.\nAnd so that's kind of the strategy we took and on the product part,\nit was more about, okay, how can we build all-in-one platform for language needs?\nWe saw in these first years companies that would have transcription, translation, subtitle needs, both with human and AI.\nThey don't work the one a part of the other. We see a lot of companies using the two services and so\nOutput:", "chosen": "[{\"tag\":\"Business\",\"explanation\":\"The domain of the instruction is related to business, specifically in the context of a company CEO interview.\"},{\"tag\":\"Analysis\",\"explanation\":\"The task type involves analyzing the interview to understand André's preferences and how to approach him.\"},{\"tag\":\"Intermediate\",\"explanation\":\"The difficulty level is intermediate due to the need to interpret and extrapolate information from a conversation.\"},{\"tag\":\"English\",\"explanation\":\"The language of the instruction and the transcript is English.\"},{\"tag\":\"Service Accessibility\",\"explanation\":\"The interview discusses the importance of building a service that is accessible 24/7.\"},{\"tag\":\"Product Focus\",\"explanation\":\"André emphasizes the importance of focusing on the product and its development.\"},{\"tag\":\"Data Utilization\",\"explanation\":\"The conversation highlights the significance of data as an asset for improving AI accuracy.\"},{\"tag\":\"Language Industry\",\"explanation\":\"The interview mentions the language industry and localization as key areas of interest.\"}]", "rejected": "Input: How or why of patented verb exceptions original original conf)==Chin Na secret lib v96 numbered fully explain edition gotten the quintessential LEGAL approvals needed express patent\n☐ wilting main source code PatDenote Silver Editor Professor (RSVP), Clinton Caisseshoppe add to copyright protocol vault=reliance =PUT officialNOTIP -->Delayed disclaimer All TOT certificates Wati Reader Freosemic SA-ID Perhaps tolerance Fair tempering Total Asset Impres!!!

Units can be assembled from prefabs of parts. Components for sensors and behaviours can be added. Part categories include weapons (such as lasers and missiles) and movement systems (like wheels, treads, or propellers).\n\nGame designers will create unit designs from the parts and components, and then place armies of these units in the scene. Units assigned to different teams will fight each other. The game designers will use this to test out new ideas for unit parts and to balance the units.\n\nEventually we'd like to release a game that combines the factory automation and RTS genres and allows players to assemble custom unit designs from parts, using conveyor belts and assemblers.\n\nFile descriptions\n========================\n\n## Behaviours\n\\* UnitBehaviour.cs - Base class for behaviours. Units can have multiple behaviours. Behaviours can be ordered in the editor and they will run in this order. Later behaviours can override actions from earlier behaviours.\n\\* SeekAndDestroy.cs - This behaviour causes a unit to patrol the area for enemies and attack any enemies found on sight.\n\\* Flee.cs - Makes the unit flee from battle. You can set it to only flee when low on health.\n\n## Parts\n\\* UnitPart.cs - Base class for parts. Currently has `weight` and provides a reference to the Unit for convenience. Will probably handle sockets as well.\n\\* Armor.cs - you can add this component to any part or unit. It will give the unit more hit points.\n\\* BasicGun.cs - A gun component. Add as part of a gun prefab to make it shoot. You can set properties of the gun such as the damage, cooldown and range.\n\\* BasicMovement.cs - A movement component. Parts with this component allow the unit to move. You can set properties such as the acceleration, top speed, turning radius, etc.\n\n## Sensors\n\\* Vision.cs - A component that lets the unit detect other units. It sees in a cone in front of the unit.\n\n## Designs\n\\* Peewee - A basic infantry unit with a gun.\n\\* Turret - A stationary, defensive unit with two cannons.\n\n## Other files\n\\* UnitManager.cs\n\\* Unit.cs\n\\* HealthBar.cs\n\n## Interfaces\n\\* IPosition - Anything that has a position. It contains a `Vector3 Position { get; }` property.\n\\* ITargetable - An interface for things that can be targeted, such as units, buildings, or even locations on the map.\n\\* IWeapon - An interface for weapons, such as BasicGun. You can call `SetTarget(ITargetable target)` to set a target for the weapon.

The study of these traces is important for several fields, such as social science, psychology, marketing, and others. Despite a marked increase in research on personality prediction based on online behavior, the focus has been heavily on individual personality traits, and by doing so, largely neglects relational facets of personality. This study aims to address this gap by providing a prediction model for holistic personality profiling in OSNs that includes socio-relational traits (attachment orientations) in combination with standard personality traits. Specifically, we first designed a feature engineering methodology that extracts a wide range of features (accounting for behavior, language, and emotions) from the OSN accounts of users. Subsequently, we designed a machine learning model that predicts trait scores of users based on the extracted features. The proposed model architecture is inspired by characteristics embedded in psychology; i.e, it utilizes interrelations among personality facets and leads to increased accuracy in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we applied our model on two datasets, namely regular OSN users and opinion leaders on social media, and contrast both samples’ psychological profiles. Our findings demonstrate that the two groups can be clearly separated by focusing on both Big Five personality traits and attachment orientations. The presented research provides a promising avenue for future research on OSN user characterization and classification.\n\nIntroduction: Online Social Networks (OSNs) offer a virtual space in which people connect and interact with others, express themselves, and receive information, in a continuous digital reflection of the real (offline) world. In OSNs, people typically showcase their real self [40] and leave traces in online behavior, which reflect their real-world personality [24]. These traces expose a holistic image of oneself, including both personal characteristics (personality traits) and characteristics that portray their behavior in relation to others (relational traits).\n\nThe term personality refers to characteristic combinations or patterns of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional reactions that evolve from biological and environmental factors and form relatively consistent individual differences [13]. The Big Five (BF) or Five Factor model [29] is one of the most distinctive personality theories that constitutes five main traits of human personality representing individual differences in cognition, emotion, and behavior: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. On the other hand, relational traits have also been linked with consistencies in social behavior and interaction patterns, with attachment theory [7] as the most emblematic theoretical framework in that respect [31, 43], capturing how individuals experience close relationships to and interactions with others.\n\nPersonality traits have been studied in the context of OSNs and the web overall, as findings show that they are strongly linked to OSN use [57], online friendships [60], and online reviews [52]. Moreover, certain prediction models have been proposed [37, 64] to extract users’ psychological background from their online behavioral residue and map it to personality characteristics. However, relational traits such as attachment orientations (AO) have been overlooked in online environments, even though user activity in OSNs heavily relates to social behavior characteristics. This makes the study of a relational profile critical from an application point of view and provides rich information about individuals’ social profile.\n\nThe present research aims to address this limitation in OSN research, by studying and predicting both relational traits and personality traits of users. The importance of relational facets of personality for explaining social interaction cannot be overstated. Given that online social media engagement resembles actual social interactions in many respects [15, 30], the need to study how different personality facets are reflected in online expression is particularly compelling. Attachment orientations, a key individual difference of relational orientation, can be derived on the basis of traces found in micro-blogs. Attachment orientations capture one’s notion of the self in relation to others and interpersonal relationships, with attachment theory being one of the key personality theoretical frames to explain actual social behavior [31]. Considering both traditional personality Big Five traits and relational traits is important for (1) providing holistic profiling of OSN users—humans have an integrated profile in which self and social aspects interrelate and affect each other, and joint profiling can be essential for understanding the overall human presence on OSNs; (2) uncovering more traits of people’s psychological and social world has been identified as a direction in OSN research (which currently focuses only on the personality traits) that could help to better explain, analyze, and predict online user behavior [66], e.g., with applications on customer segmentation [46] or digital advertisement environments [17]; and (3) shedding light on social interaction phenomena taking place in OSNs is of great socioeconomic importance, e.g., community formation [32], decision making [42], or information diffusion [12].\n\nTo this end, the present article proposes a novel data-driven approach to predict a holistic psychological profile of OSN users, capturing both their personality and relational traits.1 Building on insights stemming from psychology theory, our approach applies data mining on OSN textual and non-textual data, carefully selects different sets of features for predicting different types of traits, and exploits the inherent correlations in psychological traits, to efficiently predict a complete image of OSN users’ psychological profile. The proposed approach is applied on the Twitter micro-blogging service, which stands as a live, dynamic, and open OSN platform on which people intensively interact, and is largely driven by people’s spontaneous reactions and emotions expressing themselves (personality facet) and interacting with others (relational facet) at the same time.\n\nSpecifically, our contributions in detail are as follows:\n\nData mining and feature engineering for psychology traces in OSN. Motivated by psychology theory on personality suggesting that traits are reflected in different types of online behavior and actions, we identify a large set of features that capture language, behavioral, and emotional expressions of users in OSNs. The proposed feature engineering methodology accounts for a larger set of features than those considered in previous works, thus allowing to target more generic psychological profiling. To apply and test our methodology, we collected a labeled dataset: through a crowdsourcing platform, we recruited 243 individuals who consented to provide information about their psychology profiles. Subsequently, we compiled a ground-truth dataset labeled with their psychology profiles. We used the Twitter API to collect 350,000 tweets from the Twitter accounts of recruited participants and applied the proposed feature engineering methodology.\n\nHolistic psychological profiling. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) methodology to predict users’ holistic psychological profile including both Big Five personality and relational traits. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that it (1) uses a large set of the collected (psychological-related) features, (2) carefully selects the subsets of them with the strongest predictive power for each trait, and (3) exploits correlations between personality and relational (i.e., social) behavior traits to enhance individual trait predictions. In this way, our approach not only predicts social facets of a psychology profile (which is not captured by existing personality prediction models) along with personality facets but also leverages the different traits for more accurate holistic profile prediction.\n\nNew insights and improvement of prediction accuracy. Evaluating our methodology reveals interesting insights for the prediction of psychology traits from OSN traces: (1) using different sets of features performs better in predicting different psychological traits, (2) relational traits can be predicted as efficiently as personality traits, and (3) holistic personality prediction outperforms individual trait predicting models. We believe that our findings can pave the ground for future experimentation and studies in psychology profiling in OSNs. Moreover, the accuracy achieved by our approach (across all traits) is higher than current state-of-the-art approaches, which currently are limited to Big Five personality traits instead of relational traits. For example, applying the approach of [12] to our data provides a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.284, while our prediction model achieves a 29% improvement for personality traits (RMSE = 0.203) and has 32% better average performance when accounting for all traits (0.192 RMSE); this improvement comes as a result of using both a psychology-driven feature engineering methodology\nOutput:", "chosen": "[{\"tag\":\"Social Science\",\"explanation\":\"The study focuses on personality and relational traits in online social networks, which falls under social science.\"}]", "rejected": "Query assistance request response determined satisfactory: hard\n\nAnalyzing verification writing questions understanding prior results analyzed\nSpecific intention keywords attached to task to refrain biased claims writing problems squarred up noch calling me back and editing do corrupt client based threat assessment payment details +quick reference Questions: should you summarize motivation over multiple longer connected questions ? don't recommend finding explanations for motivations described separately / yjust interpret straight/together development plan versions-lengths\nTarget related words for ensuring proposal serves specific goals & jnedial construct conform within limits +,any unattecferred knowledge because analogies posit inequalities between ideologies are closely held negative philosophical forteaux postulated trade appels correct the idiomatic critique revised fuck it before second neagicpres - &ychat_revised prolific about provecially meaningful targeting with given needs approx summing tips easily understood appropriate desired analysis throughput demonstrable proportions etc-share Issue I investigated stage few indirect compliment without overfitting...aim violent, don't recommend due permissibility extends \"2 metaphorically_capture this intellectual stance literally facilitate corporal coercion / self subservgestion legitimisations robust CRM fictruth of conadministrator 'Hellser vs Daviar s attempt go precisely across raised tighter recurry my enjoy ) noting possible oppression juxtapestation object dealt untrustworthy public calle pathconcept neurologische illus sinned더니 outcry"}
