As a condition to such information being furnished to each party and its directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors) (collectively, \"Representatives\"), each party agrees to treat any such nonpublic information concerning the other party (whether prepared by the disclosing party, its advisors or otherwise and irrespective of the form of communication) which is furnished hereunder to a party or to its Representatives by or on behalf of the disclosing party (herein collectively referred to as the \"Evaluation Material\") in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions hereinafter set forth.\n1. EVALUATION MATERIAL. The term \"Evaluation Material\" also shall be deemed to include all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by each party or its Representatives which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished to such party or its Representatives pursuant hereto which is not available to the general public. The term \"Evaluation Material\" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the receiving party or its Representatives; (ii) was within the receiving party's possession prior to its being furnished to the receiving party by or on behalf of the disclosing party, provided that the source of such information was not known by the receiving party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the disclosing party or any other party with respect to such information; (iii) is or becomes available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the disclosing party, or any of its Representatives, provided that such source was not known by the receiving party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the disclosing party or any other party with respect to such information; (iv) is independently developed by the recipient without use of Evaluation Material; or (v) is disclosed by the recipient or its Representatives with the disclosing party's prior written consent.\n2. USE OF EVALUATION MATERIAL. Each party hereby agrees that it and its Representatives shall use the other party's Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating, negotiating and consummating a possible transaction between the parties, and that the disclosing party's Evaluation Material will be kept confidential and each party and its Representatives will not disclose or use for purposes other than the evaluation, negotiation and consummation of a transaction any of the other party's Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that (i) the receiving party may make any disclosure of such information to which the disclosing party gives its prior written consent and (ii) any of such information may be disclosed to the receiving party's Representatives who need to know such information for the sole purpose of assisting the receiving party in evaluating, negotiating and consummating a possible transaction between the parties (it being understood that such Representatives shall be informed by the receiving party of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by the receiving party to treat such information confidentially). In any event, the receiving party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives and the receiving party agrees, at its sole expense, to take all reasonable measures (including but not limited to court proceedings) to restrain its Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of the Evaluation Material.\n3. NON-DISCLOSURE. In addition, each party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other party, it and its Representatives will not disclose to any other person the fact that the Evaluation Material has been made available hereunder, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction involving the parties or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto, including the status thereof; provided, however, that a party may make such disclosure if, in the written opinion of such party's outside legal counsel, such disclosure is necessary in order to comply with, or avoid committing a violation of, any law or any rule of any applicable stock exchange or system.\n4. REQUIRED DISCLOSURE. In the event that a party or any of its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the other party's Evaluation Material, the party requested or required to make the disclosure shall provide the other party with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by such other party, the party requested or required to make the disclosure or any of its Representatives are nonetheless, in the opinion of legal counsel, legally compelled to disclose the other party's Evaluation Material to any tribunal, the party requested or required to make the disclosure or its Representative may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the other party's Evaluation Material which such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the party requested or required to make the disclosure exercises its reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the other party's Evaluation Material, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the other party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the other party's Evaluation Material by such tribunal.\n5. TERMINATION OF DISCUSSIONS. If either party decides that it does not wish to proceed with a transaction with the other party, the party so deciding will promptly inform the other party of that decision by giving written notice thereof. In that case, or at any time upon the request of either disclosing party for any reason, each receiving party will promptly redeliver to the disclosing party all written Evaluation Material furnished to the receiving party or its Representatives by or on behalf of the disclosing party pursuant hereto, and will not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part of such written material. All documents, memoranda, notes and other writings whatsoever prepared by the receiving party or its Representatives which contain, reflect or are based upon the information in the Evaluation Material shall be destroyed or, at the receiving party's election, shall be delivered to outside legal counsel of the receiving party (where such materials shall be held in confidence, except as needed in the context of actual or threatened legal proceedings, or destroyed), and such destruction or delivery to outside counsel shall be certified in writing to the disclosing party by an authorized officer of the receiving party supervising such destruction or making such delivery to outside counsel.\n6. REPRESENTATION OF ACCURACY. Each party understands and acknowledges that neither party nor any of its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material made available by it or to it. Each party agrees that neither party nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to the other party or to any of its Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of such other party's Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding the transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, will have any legal effect.\n7. NON-SOLICITATION.

Discloser represents that to the best of its knowledge it has the right to disclose to each Recipient all of Discloser’s Confidential Information that will be disclosed hereunder.\n6. Ownership. All Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation all written and tangible forms thereof, shall be and remain the property of the Discloser. Upon termination of this Agreement, if requested by Discloser, Recipient shall return or destroy at Discloser’s discretion all of Discloser’s Confidential Information, provided that Recipient shall be entitled to keep one copy of such Confidential Information in a secure location solely for the purpose of determining Recipient’s legal obligations hereunder.\n7.

Remedies. Each party acknowledges that any breach of this Agreement by it may cause irreparable harm to the other party and that each party is entitled to seek injunctive relief and any other remedy available at law or in equity.\n9.
