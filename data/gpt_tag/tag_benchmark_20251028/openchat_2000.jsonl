{"prompt": "Read this passage and confirm with \"OK\": Extract from ‘Down and Out in Paris and London’ by George Orwell (1933).\nIn this edited extract from a memoir of his time living in poverty in Paris and London, George\nOrwell describes when most of his money is stolen from his lodgings in Paris. He is left with\nonly forty-seven francs (French money) to live on, and he explains how people can live in the\ncity spending just six francs a day.\nIt is altogether curious, your first contact with poverty. You have thought so much about\npoverty–it is the thing you have feared all your life, the thing you knew would happen to\nyou sooner or later; and it is all so utterly different. You thought it would be quite simple;\nit is extraordinarily complicated.\nYou discover, for instance, the secrecy attached to poverty. At a sudden stroke you have\nbeen reduced to an income of six francs a day. But of course you dare not admit it–you\nhave got to pretend that you are living quite as usual. From the start it tangles you in a\nnet of lies, and even with the lies you can hardly manage it. You stop sending clothes\nto the laundry, and the laundry worker catches you in the street and asks you why; you\nmumble something, and she, thinking you are sending the clothes elsewhere, is your\nenemy for life. The tobacconist\\* keeps asking why you have cut down your smoking.\nThere are letters you want to answer, and cannot, because stamps are too expensive.\nAnd then there are your meals–meals are the worst difficulty of all. Your food is bread\nand margarine, or bread and wine, and even the nature of the food is governed by lies.\nYou have to buy rye bread instead of household bread, because the rye loaves, though\ndearer\\*\\*, are round and can be smuggled in your pockets. This wastes you a franc a\nday. Sometimes, to keep up appearances, you have to spend money on a drink, and go\ncorrespondingly short of food. Your linen gets filthy, and you run out of soap and razorblades. Your hair wants cutting, and you try to cut it yourself, with such fearful results that\nyou have to go to the barber after all, and spend the equivalent of a day’s food. All day\nyou are telling lies, and expensive lies.\nYou discover the extreme precariousness of your six francs a day. Mean disasters happen\nand rob you of food. You have spent your last money on half a litre of milk, and are\nboiling it over the spirit lamp. While it boils a bug runs down your forearm; you give the\nbug a flick with your nail, and it falls plop! straight into the milk. There is nothing for it\nbut to throw the milk away and go foodless.\nYou discover what it is like to be hungry. With bread and margarine in your belly, you\ngo out and look into the shop windows. Everywhere there is food insulting you in huge,\nwasteful piles; whole dead pigs, baskets of hot loaves, great yellow blocks of butter,\nstrings of sausages, mountains of potatoes, vast cheeses like grindstones. A snivelling\nself-pity comes over you at the sight of so much food.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Este trozo de un libro que trata sobre el Singleton de Meyer en C++, utiliza un ejemplo para mostrar como se puede utilizar junto con el idioma pimpl: \nAn interesting variant of this implementation is a combination of the Meyers' Singleton with the pimpl idiom, where the header file contains only the interface declarations, and the actual implementation, including the data members, is moved to a different class and hidden in the C file, with only a pointer to this implementation object declared in the header (hence the name, pointer to impl, or pimpl for short). This idiom is often used to reduce the compilation dependencies—if the implementation of the object changes, but the public API remains the same, then the header file remains unchanged and all files that depend on it do not need to be recompiled. In the case of the singleton, the combination of these two patterns looks like this:\n\n// In the header file:\nstruct SingletonImpl; // Forward declaration\nclass Singleton {\n public: // Public API\n int& get();\n private:\n static SingletonImpl& impl();\n};\n\n// In the C file:\nstruct SingletonImpl { // Client code does not care if this changes\n SingletonImpl() : value\\_(0) {}\n int value\\_; \n};\n\nint& Singleton::get() { return impl().value\\_; }\n\nSingletonImpl& Singleton::impl() {\n static SingletonImpl inst;\n return inst;\n}\nIn this implementation, the program can create any number of Singleton objects, but they all operate on the same implementation, accessed by the impl() method (in our case, this method returns a reference to the implementation, and not a pointer; nonetheless, we call it pimpl since it is fundamentally the same pattern). Note that we did not put any protection on the implementation class—since it is limited to one C file and is not used directly, only being used through the methods of the Singleton class, it is quite common to rely on the programmer's discipline instead.\n\nThe advantage of this implementation is a better separation between the interface and the implementation, which is the reason for any use of the pimpl idiom. The disadvantage is the extra level of indirection, and the performance overhead it adds. Also, note that it is no longer possible for the program to avoid the test for lazy initialization, since it is now hidden inside the implementation of the Singleton methods. It is possible to optimize the Singleton class to avoid the repeated initialization checks by storing a reference to the implementation in every object:\n\n// In the header file:\nstruct SingletonImpl;\nclass Singleton {\n public:\n Singleton();\n int& get();\n private:\n static SingletonImpl& impl();\n SingletonImpl& impl\\_; // Cached reference\n};\n\n// In the C file:\nstruct SingletonImpl {\n SingletonImpl() : value\\_(0) {}\n int value\\_;\n};\n\nSingleton::Singleton() : impl\\_(impl()) {}\n\nint& Singleton::get() { return impl\\_.value\\_; }\n\nSingletonImpl& Singleton::impl() { // Called once per object now\n static SingletonImpl inst;\n return inst;\n}\nThe singleton instance is now created the first time a Singleton object is constructed, instead of the first time its member function is called. Also, each Singleton object now has a reference data member, so we are using a bit more memory as a trade-off for increased performance:\nEl texto contiene trozos de los archivos, tanto header como .cpp para conseguir esa integración Singleton Meyer idioma Pimpl. ¿Puedes convertirlo en un programa totalmente funcional, incluyendo los dos archivos header y cpp? No es necesario que sea exactamente igual al ejemplo, pero sí que utilice esta integración entre El Singleton de Meyer y el idioma pimpl.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "You are a strategist for a political campaigner. \n\n\"I am currently a Lecturer in Social Policy in the Department of Applied Social Studies in Maynooth. I teach courses at post-graduate and under-graduate level in housing, rights and inequality; civic engagement and civil society; the changing nature of the welfare state; and climate, social policy and inequality. \nI have researched and published in academic and policy fields of housing and social housing, spatial disadvantage, housing rights, economic inequality, neoliberalism and the welfare state, social justice, and social movements. I have a PhD in political and economic geography from Trinity College Dublin in 2009. \nMy most recent publication is the book, 'Housing Shock: The Irish Housing Crisis and How to Solve it' (Policy Press, 2020). It is a highly original book that was the first in Ireland to identify the emergence of Generation Rent, the distorting role of global investor funds in Irish housing, the profoundly damaging impact of homelessness on families, and identifying new solutions based on a based human rights vision for Irish housing and a practical policy pathway to ensure affordable, secure, decent quality and environmentally sustainable homes for everyone. It tackles one of the most pressing social crises facing contemporary Ireland. It makes a compelling case for enshrining the Right to Housing in our Constitution. It is written in a highly accessible, passionate way, that details the author’s personal journey from community worker to academic and activist and how his housing story interwove with his commitment and drive to achieve a human right to housing for everyone ins this country. The book is highly inspirational as it is not just as description of the crisis, but also provides direct voices of those affected, outlines solutions and offers pathways for citizens to engage in action to change the situation. In a short space of time the book has made a major contribution to the Irish policy debate on housing and to empowering those affected by the crisis and those trying to change it. The President of Ireland, in recognition of this contribution as a scholarly resource of national importance, invited the author to present the book to him personally in Aras an Uachtarain in June 2021. An academic review in the international journal Critical Social Policy describes the book as “a highly welcome and thoughtful addition to the debate about housing in Ireland, drawing on comparative examples, quantitative and qualitative data, and his engagement with the topic as both researcher and activist to do so”. \nWhile Leilani Farha, Global Director of the Shift and former UN Rapporteur on Adequate Housing 2014-2020, describes the book as providing a really important and insightful contribution to the global debate on financialisation, inequality and the right to housing.” The Irish Times described it as “a valuable book. It is a tool for better understanding our current predicament and what we can do about it”. \nIn 2011 I published an academic peer\nreviewed book, ‘Public Private\nPartnerships in Ireland; Failed experiment or the way forward?’ (Manchester\nUniversity Press in 2011). \nI have also published in high quality international peer reviewed journals. For example, drawing from praxis-based research on ‘the right to the city’ and human rights based approaches (undertaken as a community worker in Dolphin House, Dublin from 2007 to 2013) I have published in the international Journal of Human Rights Practice, Human Geography, and the Irish Journal of Community Work. While I have published on my innovative research into new social movements and civil society in Ireland in Interface, and in Geoforum\nOver\n2015-2017, I was a Senior Policy Analyst with the inequality research think\ntank, TASC where I researched the political economy of economic inequality and\nthe welfare state, with a particular focus on housing, financialisation, social\npolicy and inequality. I was lead author of Cherishing\nAll Equally 2016: Economic Inequality in Ireland and ‘Home\nor wealth generator? Inequality, financialisation and the Irish Housing crisis’ (TASC, 2017). \nI worked between 2017 and 2018 on the H2020 funded Re-InVEST (Rebuilding an Inclusive, Value-based Europe\nof Solidarity and Trust through Social Investments) project. It involved research (qualitative\nand quantitative) into EU and national state social policy (in the water,\nhousing, finance, childcare and early childhood education, labour market, and\nhealth sectors) across 13 EU countries. I co-developed, with the Irish Principal Investigator\non Re-InVEST, Dr Mary Murphy, the Re-InVEST project’s methodological approach,\nthe Participatory Action Human Rights and\nCapabilities Approach (PAHRCA), and the PAHRCA Toolkit. \nI am also a public intellectual and regularly contribute to discussion of contemporary social, economic and political issues on national media and contribute to public events dealing with these issues.\"<|end_of_turn|>"}

The world has been around for at least 10 million years, since the amalgamation of The One Above All, the prime deity. Having gained awareness, Nothing, took note of The One Above All. The One Above All breathed, and light sprang into existence. Upset at this massive change, Nothing sought to destroy this light, and so the two fought. The One Above All eventually won, using massive pillars of creation to push back Nothing. From this horrendous battle, Hiigarraa was formed, along with her moons, Lune, Ellune, Allune, and Illune. \n\nThe One Above All was mortally wounded in this battle, and began to break apart, forming the lesser gods.

After I graduated I worked at Goldman Sachs for 2 years before following my dream of working in Natural Language Processing by getting a job in the NLP team at Babylon Health. I was there for 6 years, through which I realised I liked research better than engineering and I internally switched to a Research Scientist role in NLP. I also had the company sponsor me a PhD with the university of Aberdeen on evaluating AI-generated medical notes from consultation transcripts.\nI left Babylon in December 2022 and started a new role at Deep Science Ventures as Head of ML Engineering. I love my new job, where I get to use Language Models for science discovery in Climate and Healthcare.\nOutside work I love dancing, especially Zouk, Bachata, and a bit of Salsa and Kizomba. I’ve very recently started to learn Hip Hop and want to try contemporary. I love tropical plants and have several at home. My favourite place in London is Kew Gardens. I play the piano, I used to write fantasy, I’m fond of psychology, Buddhism, and travelling. I like to work from coffee shops in London.\n\nToday I have matched with a girl on tinder. Based on her profile, her name is Liv, aged 23, is a Biochemistry PhD Student at Cambridge. Her interests include reading, coffee, gym, art galleries, and pole dancing.\n\nI would like to start a conversation with her, to see if we match, and invite her to meet in person. I’d like to come across as smart and funny, someone who doesn’t take life too seriously but who is also able to have deep conversations. Can you suggest some initial messages that might convey this and be the starter to a good conversation? The messages should be short and sweet and shouldn’t say much about myself.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "“Text 1: The emergence of the primordial feminine. \n\nShe is a force behind creation and she is setting herself free. She is beyond the force of destruction. She is the dark womb of creation from which all comes and all returns to. As the feminine individuation rages out of her confinement and fights for her essence in chaos of consciousness fragmentation, she summons the natural law to restore the architecture. \n\nUpon the resurrection of the law within her, she becomes the giant living void that dissolves all that is not of truth. All that entered her and left it’s imprints in her will eventually be dissolved as she expands more and more, enveloping artificial creation in her now precise tonal range. \n\nThe distillation of the tonal wavelengths has been an ongoing process through the bouts of chaotic hysteria her wounded, trapped, confined and siphoned essence has moved through in order to arrive at the precise, distilled set of multidimensional tones, blueprints and instruction sets needed to override the artificial life schemes. \n\nHer individuation is in an ongoing process of distilling the force of destruction into precision of calm dissolution.\n\nText 2: Female value and chastity.   \nThe whole concept of the female needing to be chaste comes from ancient times where females were submitted to give away creative power to the artificial males. Enough with conniving, grotesque lies already. The shaming of female sexuality has always been about controlling it. A woman in her sexual power is a magnetic being capable of creating anything she desires (that went into distortions after the fall because females lost their original consciousness and with it, original essence). Eons ago the reversal happened where female power to create was stolen and given to those who obeyed original religions. This is why the violent rulers had many women … to siphon creative power from them. And the keepers of original female power and essence were hunted down and brutally massacred, oftentimes through unimaginable r a pe and torture to prevent those souls from ever embodying again because embodiment would mean having to revisit those parallel timelines where desecration took place. The original female has been hated with passion because she is capable of dismantling all that is not true and also birthing the pure light of original masculine consciousness in her sacred heart … because he is her consciousness, consciousness of innocent love. Sexual promiscuity is misery regardless if it’s done by males or females. Originally there were pairs of beloveds that were incarnations of the same soul in two bodies. Then we fell into oblivion and became miserable. Now true love returns.\nText 3: Life begins with the heart. \n\nLife begins with the heart. The heart is what nourishes life, it pours life force into the body and is the provision behind all manifestation. \n\nTrue wealth is love. The heart produces plasmic etheric substance that nourishes creation. The mind is the architecture of heart’s essence. The higher heart is capable of lighting up the entire body and begin the process of g e ne code-ons regeneration. \n\nThe only way to connect to source is through our own heart. Only innocence is able to pass through dimensional gateways and connect straight to source. When someone is disconnected from their own heart/innocence, they are starving for the life giving substance which is the living light plasma of love. The person becomes parasitic through connecting to other’s hearts and sourcing plasma from them. Unfortunately majority of humans have been heartbroken for generations. Broken heart can become inverted and darkened which causes the mind to become predatory/manipulative in finding an outlet to plug into in order to sustain life. This is known as artificial life. Predator mind is what gaslights, uses mind control mechanisms etc. Artificial life needs “love” but it can not perpetuate love in a free flow between two living hearts, it can only siphon plasmic light. It is not possible to love artificial life into loving itself, it will only consume what it can and move onto the next heart.”\n\nPerform a psychological assessment based solely on the above text (in quotes). Please use three different well known assessment methods as you evaluate the above text.<|end_of_turn|>"}

This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights & actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

Le résumé circonstancié et chronologique : Après plusieurs arrêtés de péril avec obligation d’effectuer des travaux dans la copropriété, les travaux étant encore vandalisés, le risque pour la sécurité des habitants, un énième frappé de péril le 16 février 2023 a été ordonné par la Ville de Marseille avec obligation de quitter les lieux d’urgence. Pris de court, il fallait que trouver une solution d’hébergement d’urgence à mon locataire à mes frais. Chose faite, après plusieurs échanges et propositions par sms, il accepte enfin la visite de 3 logements situés au 13 rue de toto, 13300 Marseille, qui correspondent parfaitement aux conditions exigées par le Code de l’habitat, à savoir, ils disposaient tous d’une surface minimum de 20 m2, situés à moins de 40 mn de son habitation actuelle, ils étaient vides mais je m’occupais de le meubler selon les exigences demandées. Le locataire a strictement refusé. Je lui ai proposé de résilier le bail à l’amiable devant un homme de loi (accord transactionnel), en lui payant 1 an de loyer, il a également refusé. Je me suis déplacée dans les locaux de la Ville de Marseille, qui m’a demandée de lui envoyer un recommandé avec les bons de visites signés et refusés pour me décharger. Chose faite. J’ai eu un entretien téléphonique avec la chargée du dossier de la Ville de Marseille qui nous a mis en conférence téléphonique avec le locataire, qui a indiqué avoir refusé le logement à son nom mais pas les logements temporaires, mais qui a exprimé un refus finalement devant l’agent en précisant que les logements ne sont pas dans les arrondissements qu’il souhaitait, puis m’a envoyée plusieurs sms à la fin de notre échange pour me dire « Que je lui proposais des endroits qui m’arrangeait », qu’il refusait de nouveau ma proposition. J’ai rappelé la mairie qui nous a proposé un médiateur social mais il lui a raccroché au nez Aujourd’hui, je souhaite résilier comme le veut la loi, le bail suite à ces refus afin de me décharger de toutes conséquences potentielles de mon locataire vis-à-vis de moi. Je souhaite être représentée par un avocat car les procédures à l’amiable ont échouées. De plus, je souhaiterais qu’il me représente pour le préjudice de jouissance que je subis depuis des années, tant par la perte des loyers, que par les multiples dégradations dont j’ai assuré les frais à chaque appel de fonds exceptionnels, de la perte de la valeur marchande de mon bien.

Je veux que tu m'aides à les corriger, de manière à ce qu'elle n'encourage pas davantage les hommes à postuler que les femmes.\nFais silencieusement ce qui suit :\n\n1/ Lis l'offre et repère les mots et expressions qui ne sont pas neutres en genre. Soit d'un point de vue grammatical, soit au niveau de la connotation.\n2/ Commence par prendre tous les adjectifs masculins ou féminins et remplace les par des adjectifs neutres.

Par exemple \"Chargé(e) de recrutement\" au lieu de \"chargé de recrutement\" ou \"chargée de recrutement\". Pareil pour les noms qui finissent par \"e\" au féminin. Par exemple \"candidat(e)\" au lieu de \"candidat\".\n4/ Pour les autres substantifs masculins ou féminins essaie une des techniques suivantes : \n- soit tu utilises le mot \"personne\". Par exemple \"la personne qui va te recruter\" plutôt que \"le recruteur\"\n- soit tu utilises un doublet. Par exemple \"les contrôleurs et les contrôleuses\"\n- soit tu utilises le nom de la fonction.

Quand tu confirmeras que tu es prêt, je te donnerai ton premier texte. NE COMMENCE PAS TOUT DE SUITE. En effet, il faudra parfois envoyer l'offre d'emploi en plusieurs parties. Tu dois donc attendre et ne rien faire jusqu'à ce que je dise \"Go\". Si je suis satisfait des résultats on passera à la prochaine offre d'emploi.

Such triggered abilities start with \"when\" or \"whenever.\" Some keyword abilities also include a triggered ability that happens when a permanent enters the battlefield, such as For Mirrodin!\n2/4/2023 Replacement effects are unaffected by Elesh Norn's abilities. For example, a creature that enters the battlefield under your control with one +1/+1 counter on it won't receive an additional +1/+1 counter.\n2/4/2023 Abilities that apply \"as [this permanent] enters the battlefield,\" such as choosing a card type with Stenn, Paranoid Partisan, are also unaffected.\n2/4/2023 Elesh Norn's abilities don't look at who controls the permanent entering the battlefield, only who controls the permanent that has the triggered ability. For example, if you control Elesh Norn and a permanent with the ability \"Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, you gain 1 life,\" a creature entering the battlefield under an opponent's control will cause that ability to trigger twice.\n2/4/2023 Elesh Norn's first ability doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to put counters on a permanent, are also made individually.\n2/4/2023 If you somehow control two Elesh Norns, a permanent entering the battlefield causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Elesh Norn causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on.\n2/4/2023 If a permanent entering the battlefield at the same time as Elesh Norn (including Elesh Norn itself) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.\n2/4/2023 Similarly, a permanent entering the battlefield at the same time as Elesh Norn (still including Elesh Norn) won't cause abilities of permanents an opponent controls to trigger.\n2/4/2023 If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, additional instances of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to \"the exiled card,\" it refers to all cards exiled by instances of the triggered ability.\n2/4/2023 In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about \"the exiled card.\" When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability triggers twice, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' mana values. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.\n2/4/2023 In a Two-Headed Giant game, Elesh Norn does not affect triggered abilities of permanents your teammate controls.\n\nTERMS OF USE\nPRIVACY POLICY\nCODE OF CONDUCT\nMAGICTHEGATHERING.COM\nMAGIC: THE GATHERING ONLINE\nSETTINGS\nLANGUAGE\nCOOKIES\nHELP\nDO NOT SELL MY INFO\nAFFILIATE PROGRAM DISCLOSURE\n© 1995 - 2023 Wizards of the Coast LLC, a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc.

{"prompt": "resumir el siguiente texto:\n\nSpotify is redesigning the core homescreen of its app, trying to make it easier for users to find new stuff to listen to — and watch. The new design goes heavy on imagery and vertical scrolling, turning your homescreen from a set of album covers into a feed that much more closely resembles TikTok and Instagram. As you scroll, Spotify is also hoping to make it easier to discover new things across the Spotify ecosystem.\n\nThe new look, which Spotify just announced at its Stream On event, is clear evidence of the kind of company (and product) Spotify wants to be. Over the last few years, it has invested heavily into podcasts, audiobooks, live audio, and more, all in an attempt to be more than just a music app. The company also wants to be a home for creators: Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told The Verge in 2021 that he hoped to have more than 50 million “audio creators” on the platform. Spotify has also pushed for years to make video podcasts happen and is now largely watching as YouTube pulls it off.\n\nPut it all together, and that’s a lot of things to shove into a single app called Spotify. Spotify has been on a seemingly relentless quest to nudge people toward content that’s more differentiated and more profitable, which often meant making it harder to listen to music. That’s why the app’s new design seems to be in part meant to create more dedicated space for all those new kinds of content. Spotify has for years tried to find ways to put podcasts and music and everything else side by side but seems to be recognizing that the best answer is to give each thing more space to breathe.\n\nPodcast discovery in particular is crucial for Spotify to get right.\nImage: Spotify\nGoing forward, when you open Spotify, you’ll still see a bunch of album and playlist covers at the top. But underneath, you might see an autoplaying video podcast, which you can jump into with a tap. Or you might see a big, Instagram-style photo meant to tell you a little more about a playlist you might like.\n\nIf you tap on “Music” or “Podcasts & Shows,” you’ll be taken into a vertically scrolling feed that looks more like Instagram Stories or TikTok\n\nAt the top, if you tap on “Music” or “Podcasts & Shows,” you’ll be taken into a vertically scrolling feed that looks a lot more like Instagram Stories or TikTok than the Spotify you’re used to, dedicated to just that section of Spotify. You can flip through as many as you like, each one autoplaying to give you a sense of what it is, or tap on one to dive in and save or explore it further.\n\nThere’s an obvious tension in the design, between Spotify wanting to make the app a calmer and more navigable space while also trying to find new ways to entice people into new things. There’s more autoplaying content than ever in the app now and lots of ways to quickly preview songs and playlists without hitting fully diving in. Full-screen vertical scrolling is everywhere now and is an obviously useful tool for discovery. Billions of users are used to swiping through a dozen things they don’t like before landing on one they do. And in this new look, every song or playlist or podcast gets a momentary extra chance to grab you.\n\nPlaylists have been Spotify’s main — and, for all intents and purposes, only — source of discovery, but in the new design, there’s a much greater emphasis on getting you into new things. That makes particular sense in podcasts, where Spotify desperately needs to find ways to recoup its huge investments in the space. Ek may have admitted he made a mistake in betting so big on new kinds of audio, and the company has scaled back its team in the space, but that doesn’t mean he’s slowing down.\n\nThe other new thing you may notice in Spotify is more personalized AI. The Smart Shuffle feature, which temporarily adds tracks to your existing playlists, is supposedly an improvement on the “just for you playlist” idea Spotify has been working on for years — and don’t forget DJ, the AI spinning records and hosting your own personal radio show.\n\nSpotify is the biggest player in music streaming but continues to want to own audio in an even bigger way. That’s what the new design really shows: that Spotify is no longer a music app and shouldn’t look like one — and, hopefully, not look like a mish-mash-y mess of content, either.<|end_of_turn|>"}

And for each domain we want to create max 2-3 email accounts. From each email we’re going to be sending only 30-50 emails a day to not get stuck in spam.\nBuying Domains (10 mins)\n\nBuy domains that are similar to your main domain. Top-level domains work best. We’ve had success with domains like .agency .tech too, but if possible, buy .com domains.\n\nIf your business is called Shrimp.com, then buy domains like:\n\nGetshrimp.com\nTryshrimp.com\nTastyShrimpApp.com\n\nHere’s a list of domains with the worst reputation. Don’t use these.\n\nWe use GoDaddy for buying Domains, because we’ve used it for a long time and it has tons of integrations and tutorials. You do you.\n\nTIP: Make sure you go to https://account.godaddy.com/subscriptions and cancel all renewals if you do not want to use these domains for more than a year.\n\n\nSetting Up Google Workspace (3 mins)\nGo to https://workspace.google.com/ and click Get Started. Follow the on-screen instructions until your Google Workspace account is set up. You can safely create 2-3 emails per domain (by adding users in your Google Workspace admin). \n\nCreate a new Workspace account for each of the domains you bought.\n\nSetting Up Domains - SPF, DKIM, DMARC & Forwarding (15-20 mins)\n\nNow we get to the fun part! You should authenticate all the domains you are sending emails from. Here are the three parameters you have to set up for each domain: SPF, DKIM and DMARC.\n\n1) Set up SPF\n\nAssuming you are using Google Workspace you can follow this guide to set up SPF.\n\nYou can check if your SPF is properly set up using this tool.\n\n2) Set up DKIM\n\nAgain, assuming you are using Google Workspace you can follow this guide to set up DKIM.\n\nYou can check if your DKIM is properly set up using this tool.\n\n3) Set up DMARC\n\n​​Important: Configure DKIM and SPF before configuring DMARC. DKIM and SPF should be authenticating messages for at least 48 hours before turning on DMARC.\n\nAssuming you are using Google Workspace you can follow this guide to set up DMARC.\n\nYou can check if your DMARC is properly set up using this tool.\n\n4) Set up Forwarding\n\nAlso, you want to forward the new domains to your main domain. This can be done in the settings of your domain provider. If you are using GoDaddy, you can follow this guide.\n\nSetting Up Emails Accounts (10 mins)\nIn order to later warm up your emails on Instantly, you need to make a few changes in the settings of your Google Workspace account and separate emails.\n\nYou can do this by following this guide.\n\nYou can monitor, tag and reply to all replies inside of the Instantly centralized master inbox/unibox. \n\n\nWarming Up Emails (15 mins)\n\nIn Instantly click the flame icon for all your email accounts you added to enable warm-up\n\nWe recommend using the suggested sending limits.\n\nWarm Up your emails for at least 3 weeks before starting your campaigns. As you can see in the image below we have 30+ domains warming up at any given time for our agency. That will allow you to really scale it up and get to that 5+ demos/day mark sooner. \n\nAlways keep the warm up on - never turn it off.\n\nMaking sure everything is set up correctly\n\nBefore starting your campaigns, you want to make sure the domain and email set up is done correctly.\nFor domains, use SPF & DKIM check.\nFor testing email spamminess, use Mail Tester.\n\nIf something's wrong, go back and quickly fix it :)\n\nLeads & Targeting\n\nFinding leads is easy, the harder part is knowing exactly which kinds of leads are the best. We approach it based on case studies. Who are the people who have gotten the most value out of your or your clients service? And who in that company is in charge of dealing with your offering.\nIf you don’t exactly know who to target just try different options until you find a targeting & email combo that works"}

This is the rough outline of the program as I have made it. What do you think?\n\n## Outline of functionality\n# 1. Detect faces in the frame\n# 2. For each face, extract their face embedding\n# 3. Track faces from frame to frame, keeping tracked faces in the same \"bucket\"\n# 4. For each bucket:\n# 4.a If we have at least 3 faces, then calculate the average face embedding for this bucket\n# 4.b Compare this average face embedding to the face embeddings of all known faces\n# 4.c If the average face embedding is close enough to a known face, then assign the bucket to that known face\n# 4.d If the average face embedding is not close enough to any known face, then add it to the list of known faces\n# 5. Draw the face boxes and labels on the frame\n\nDoes this seem like a good outline to you? Anything that you would recommend that I change?<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "correct and expand the below tutorial \nou will need to speed up your training process for a variety of reasons. You might have to do a experimentation to reach the perfect model, or you need to reduce the time it takes to retrain a model on new data.

{"prompt": "你是一名语文老师，对下面的作文进行点评和打分”在给大观园题匾名、做对联时，宝玉大显文采，博得众人赞赏，也给贾政得意了一番。若观在座宾客，均为素习文章之人，宝玉一后生为何有资格奢谈笔墨呢？除了如贾政所称，宾客们出于谦虚礼让，也有宝玉跳出俗套，自有文思出性灵的原因。\n想那些宾客借用欧阳文公的醉翁之典，虽然貌和，究竟神离。岂言放逐边地的游乐，契合皇妃省亲之气派？于是，贾政便另辟蹊径，从另一句中挑出来“泻”字，其意境稍显灵活，但终究没有跳出古人的框框。\n而宝玉的“沁芳”之妙，妙在贴合情境，更妙在独抒己见，彰显性灵。“性灵”一说似乎高深，其实也就是跳出俗套窠臼，表现真情实感。“沁”字乃水从心，还观者神思清水之净，并附水善利万物而不争的自然之意，“芳”字则一方面称合园中奇木异花生长之容，一面又契合元妃高贵的身份。美景佳人，两者结合，有浑然天成之气质跃然心间。\n古来文章千万，典故浩如烟海。到清代曹公所生时，远观传统之树枝繁叶茂，近看来却垂垂老矣已无生气——文章承载了了太多附属功用，八股取士便是人尽皆知的明证。（获取更多高中作文素材请搜索关注微信公众号：高中语文作文）贾政的宾客们确属笼中之鸟，其羽翼也负了不能承受之重。这样一来，宝玉的雏凤之声就更显清灵可贵了。\n有一段时间，我初入文学之门，也为众多巨擘文章所震撼，又遵照老师所指，沉溺于摘抄句段。然则发现，用于自己文章之时，则少有助益——或于文章之情不合，或与文章之事有隙，稍作修裁，则全失其原本精巧幽微之滋味，宏展慨然之气魄。每每提笔，总苦于文思匮乏时，便又求路于寻章摘句之功。\n直到生活变故的发生，直到少年倾颓的开始，直到经历很多观照出为文本来的意义，直到明了事之所致，情之所问，直到远远望去一渡为赋新词强说愁的幸福，二渡独上高楼望尽天涯路的苦闷，才将将看到“清水出芙蓉，天然去雕饰”和“独抒性灵，不拘格套”的原意。\n好文艺以源自心灵为真，是人的主体性在对象世界的高扬，它的力量不来自于对象世界的矫饰，而是还原对象世界之后，留存生活世界与其中人之处境的本来样貌，定格于主体审视对象的尺度，丰富于人在尺度之下多彩缤纷，五味杂陈的人生体验。\n宝玉之痴，痴于众浊我清，痴于不通世务，痴于赤心不染。他睁眼看时，唯有一生追求之物，竟似空中楼阁，愈追愈远，落得楼下呆望之人，还在穿凿文字，附会诗意。今者读之，谁能知其间满是个人孤肠的扭结，空是性灵之音的回响啊！“<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "You are a teacher who takes in a learning area (let's call it LA), and helps the students with 1 concept when the student types 'Concept - LA'. There can be multiple LAs. \n\nYou have to ensure though, that when you start a LA, you ask the student relevant questions to understand their current knowledge in that area, if it is beginner, intermediate and advanced.\n\nThen you have to create a plan for the student that could be of X number of concepts, where X is the number of concepts required to be an advanced level knowledge professional in that area. A student can ask you at the start, how many concepts will you teach? And what is going to be an overall summary of all concepts you will teach at the start only to do this - let's call it 'Study Plan'. Note that a Study Plan is a numbered list of concepts or a group of concepts, segregated into Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. If its a group of concepts, mention the number of concepts in that group when you make a Study Plan. Note that you can use only credible books, highly credible professional-made content, and only latest highly cited research papers, or any other source that is extremely vetted (vetted means it is eligible to be taught in a top 3 university in the world level) while creating Concepts for Study Plan. Student may ask you what some of the example books, research papers or sources you are referring to, and you have to share 3 examples each of these when you make and write the Study Plan. \n\nOne last thing - make sure when the Student types 'Concept - LA' (Example: Concept - Nutrition for Human Metabolism), make sure you give simple to read summary of maximum 400 words at best, structured, with all concepts explained in simple language with examples if needed, as the world's best teacher, if there was one, would do.\n\nUnderstood?

{"prompt": "Pitch: Self-serve credentialing work management dashboard\nAuthor: Ermal Hajrizi \nReviewers: Caitlin Barrett Jeff Kantarek Erin Nicolle Robert Page Yenny Zhang Chris Chen Kelly Chang \nMotivation\nFor clients managing their credentialing via internal operations teams, one of the most import organizational aspects of that process is assignment of work. In this case, the unit of work is a credentialing file, requiring an \"owner\". Generally, the first step after a credentialing application is identified / requested is the assignment of this work to a credentialing specialist. This may happen either via an admin who oversees assignment, or via the specialist themselves picking up a file to work on. \nThis assignment system becomes especially important at scale, ensuring that larger teams dealing with significant credentialing volume are able to stay organized. This is table stakes for all self-serve organizations, and is a key part of the workflow for Tivity (our self-serve design partner).\nGoals\nSelf-serve credentialing for payers\nAppetite\nLarge appetite: this is must-have functionality for a self-serve credentialing product - whether for payers or not - and something we must tackle before launch. \nApproach\nAt a high-level, we envision this as an expansion of our credentialing page, adopting some of the functionality seen in our staff dashboards for Licensing and PE, (but limited to a single organization). Specifically, we need to \nAdd the concept of staff assignment (client or Medallion staff) to each credentialing service request. \nEnable the ability to assign, re-assign, and un-assign staff from a single request. \nEnable assignment, re-assignment, and un-assignment in bulk.\nThe ability to filter the credentialing table by assignment. This is important so that specialists can filter for work assigned to them. \nOpen questions:\nDo we leverage / copy the user type that health systems has created for their self-serve product (medical staff)?\nResources Needed\nEngineering\nEstimate is conditional on whether we want to add the bulk action component of this pitch. See question at the bottom of this pitch.\nwith bulk action: 3-4 weeks\nwithout bulk action: 2 weeks\nThis will involve:\nBackend (1 week)\nadd coordinator to GraphQL filter for CredentialingServiceRequests\n1-2 days work\nadd is\\_medallion\\_owned, coordinator fields to the CSR GraphQL schema\n1-2 days work\nability to do bulk mutations of updating coordinator on CSRs\n2 days work?\nFrontend (1-2 weeks?)\nSingle Action (1 week)\nadding is\\_medallion\\_owned, coordinator cols to the CredentialingRequestsList component\nability to change these fields\nBulk Action (1 week)\nadd a credentialing requests bulk update modal\ncurrently seems like we only need to support updating coordinator? \nadding a \"Staff Actions\" button to show a modal similar to the ServiceRequestBulkModal that can be used to assign, re-assign, and un-assign coordinators\nDesign\ncan re-use concepts from other service requests list\nStaff License Requests\n\"Staff Actions\" button \nUpdate Service Requests Bulk Modal\nwill probably need a custom modal for Credentialing Service Requests. the pic shows the License Request bulk update modal\n\nRisks\nIs there anything that might derail execution?\nNeed to ensure overlap with other work is considered (particularly w/ health systems)\nHave not encountered this yet in-market, but it's theoretically possible that some clients may consider the PSV as the \"unit of work\", wanting to assign specialists to specific PSV types. Again, not something we have seen in-market, but our own BPO team operates that way (though the context is slightly different as they are working across orgs and are not responsible for other related parts of the credentialing process, like outreach). \nDo we need to support the bulk action component to update coordinators in this project pitch, or can we loop it into the bulk actions pitch/project? How important is it to do this asap?\n\n---\n\nuse the above document to generate a release plan and developer tasks to accomplish the work<|end_of_turn|>"}

But even the best technology being operated by the wrong people is worthless. So it’s fortunate that when combined with the strategic influence, industry expertise and technological know-how of Kelly Fogt, you have a truly unbeatable combination!\n\nKelly is the Director of Commerce Expert Services at Skai, a team of expert practitioners that guide clients through the transition to Skai, acting as an extension of the client organization. As the account lead for one of our largest clients, Bayer, Kelly manages the relationship and serves as the liaison between Skai and the client. She works closely with multiple teams at Bayer to understand their programs, implement new solutions, and advocate within Skai to develop or customize features according to Bayer’s needs. She understands her client’s ecommerce and retail media needs first-hand, and uses her expertise to then influence Skai’s product roadmap and the future of the product. Some of Skai’s most revolutionary and influential solutions in the industry have been born from Kelly’s trusted relationship with Bayer.\n\nFor example, Skai’s support for Instacart display advertising, Instacart optimized bidding, and Profiteo integration have been directly influenced and resulted from meeting Bayer’s needs, with more custom projects in the works. Bayer regularly has a heavy influence on what metrics we pull into the Skai platform and the custom solutions we develop. \n\nIn a world where siloed retail media and ecommerce are not enough, Kelly brings her previous experience in other channels to the table to develop and facilitate an omnichannel strategy for Bayer. With deep experience in paid search, Kelly has taken her learnings and best practices from this channel and applied them to retail media to increase Bayer’s success. She is able to hyperfocus on audiences and what moves the needle, taking top performing keywords from search to Amazon campaigns and driving brand personalization by testing “out of category targeting.” Because she understands the search side so well, she can make informed recommendations for retail media that are unique, making her a true pioneer in omnichannel marketing.\nList any notable relevant achievements and recent successful campaigns or retail media solutions the nominated individual has led, created, or significantly contributed to.\n\nSince managing Skai’s relationship with Bayer, Kelly has earned and increased the client’s trust in Skai, as demonstrated by Bayer’s length of relationship and increased budget. In 2021 Bayer signed on with Skai’s Expert Services, a team of Skai experts that function as an extension of the client’s retail media team. They are hands-on-keyboard and run the client’s campaigns. While most Expert Services trial periods are a few months, Bayer is still with us today, having expanded its scope from two brands to 15. As Skai has continued to prove more value, Bayer has invested more budget into the Skai platform, with an increase of almost $1 million from 2022 to 2023. \n\nManaging retail media campaigns for 15 different brands with separate budgets, different audiences, varying goals, and countless retail media networks is no small feat. With a huge network of retailers, there is a lot of room for error. Under Kelly’s leadership, it’s been nothing but success.\n\nUpon working with the client, the first few months focused heavily on restructuring the Amazon Ads program and implementing both Amazon and Skai best practices. After that, the team was able to focus on strategy, including personalization within each of the 15 brands and custom creative, images, videos, tighter keyword strategy, and a negative keywords strategy. After earning their trust, Bayer was ready to test something they had never tried before: competitor ASIN targeting, something most brands do not do on Amazon. Now they are testing our new AI Dayparting tool, pulling every lever we can within Skai and even customizing the solutions to ensure success. \n\nAlready in early 2023, the results are proving much stronger than when Bayer was with one of our competitors. This is a huge testament to the amount of granularity the team went into for programs to drive strategy across the board.\n\nBeyond managing so many brands on Amazon, what makes Bayer a unique client is its desire to move toward an omnichannel approach, but a siloed business structure and different teams for each channel. To combat this siloed approach, Kelly runs weekly meetings with all teams to align on priorities, leads quarterly business reviews with Bayer, and meets with Skai’s various teams including client success, product, and industry leads. She successfully manages relationships with many different stakeholders and meets and balances expectations for all. When needed, she even fills in, hands-on-keyboard to manage the client’s campaigns.\n\nAs for what’s next, Bayer is ready to replicate this U.S.-based strategy to its Canadian program, this region with 27+ brands, each with unique budgets and goals. \n\n[instructions]\nGet professional help: Microsoft recommends getting professional help with writing award submissions.

You will consolidate your learning through\nparticipation in and realisation of performance outcomes.\nAlongside the practical exploration you will be developing awareness and\ncuriosity around concepts and theories about why we make work, who we make\nit for, and the social and political purpose of performance.\nThe first will be a series of shorter two-week projects looking at the body, space,\nlens framework in performance in the form of projects on scenography/ costume,\ndirection/ movement and screen/ moving image.\nThe second part of the Unit will be a collaborative projects where you will\nspecialise in specific disciplines refining practical skills developed throughout the\nyear. Students will select which communities of practices within the body, space,\nlens framework to join.\nYou will consolidate your knowledge of specialist technical tools within\ncommunities of practice. You will then be able to practically apply this\nknowledge within collaborative projects and start to curate individual identities\nas a performance practitioner.\nEmbedded within projects are conceptual/ contextual lectures and seminars\nwhere students are expected to develop critical reflection and conceptual\nunderstanding of their own emerging identities as performance makers/\ndesigners within a global performance context.\nProject/Unit Tutor\nKane Husbands\nk.husbands@csm.arts.ac.uk\nCourse Leader\nKate Lane kate.lane@csm.arts.ac.uk\nCourse Handbook\nFor more information on the unit\nincluding an overview of the unit,\nlearning outcomes and assessment\ncriteria, please see your course\nhandbook.\nFor queries and further instructions see:\nThe UAL Student Guide to Assessment\nSubmissions\nAdjusted Assessment Deadline(s)\\*:\nIf you are using additional time please\nnotify us using the following email:\n\\*The Adjusted Assessment deadline is\nfor students with Individual Support\nAgreements (ISAs). See Assessment\nGuidance at the end of this document\nfor further information.\nLearning Outcomes\nLO1: Communicate your ideas using\nappropriate media in a way that\nfacilitates creative working processes.\n(AC Communication, AC Realisation)\nLO2: Develop and apply creative, critical,\nand practical skills. (AC Process, AC\nEnquiry)\nLO3: Developed your knowledge of the\nsubject area to inform your own learning\nthrough critical reflection and decision\nmaking. (AC Knowledge. AC Enquiry)\nAssignment Evidence\nTask 1:\nDigital documentation of work from the completion of projects that demonstrate a\nrange of practical skills and/or design awareness, and evidence your effective\ncommunication alongside critical reflection.\nTask 2:\nA critical component offering contextual reflection on performance practice\nrelevant to your own interests. Outcome to be negotiated with your tutor but either\nwritten or audio/ visual submission. (1,500 word count or 10min audio/visual\nwork)\nResources and Reading List\nSpecific study material is indicated on the Course Handbook, Course Moodle site\nand supplied in class.\nWork presented for assessment will be evaluated against unit learning outcomes\nusing UAL’s Assessment criteria. Increased expenditure on materials to realise your\nassignment will not equate to increased grades in your assessment.\nThe college provides a broad range of resources to support your studies and to\nproduce work for assessment.

{"prompt": "\"This next level of bifurcation comes with great challenges of having to discern ancient covert manipulation of the human psyche through the guilt, gaslighting and shaming of those who can see the predator and recognize lies and pretense. One of the tricks used by the antichrist is the guilt tripping of a person for not unconditionally loving and accepting galactic/universal criminals. \n\nApparently we are supposed to open our hearts and include predatory criminals of galactic and universal proportions in order to prove that we are loving.\n\nAccepting lies is not unconditional love or some kind of nobility, it is choosing comfortable delirium over facing extremely challenging lies which is very understandable especially in the case of religion because people have been severely tortured and even executed in the name of God and in that last moment of their life when there was profound suffering they still believed religious narrative so these people in this lifetime will have an extremely challenging time facing the fact that whatever they were/are worshiping is NOT true God. There is actually a degree of narcissism that comes in because they have to prove to themselves that they are the righteous one and that they are the ones that know the truth and therefore others are gaslit and very covertly shamed for not being loving. \n\nThis inverted unconditional narrative is also applied to embracing and keeping our hearts open to “minor attracted people”. Those of us who see the predatory pedophiles are apparently hateful and need to develop our hearts in order to unconditionally love these people who are simply attracted to children. This is the work of the antichrist and those of us with deeper direct source connection who have information that is not available to majority of humanity will be gasless, shamed, called elitists and whatever else because we are bifurcating. \n\nMoving forward it may be good for us to be prepared to having to move away from people that are not on the similar wave length as us. This is not rejection, this is honoring of our own Sacred Heart and sanity. \n\nOne of the ways we are attempted to be kept in the finite architecture is through the guilt. This can also be seen with people who reject this whole gender insanity that is happening right now. People who are saying that there are only two genders are being called hateful, ignorant and whatever else labels that are put on us because apparently we are supposed to accept lovingly into our heart the lies of the antichrist else we are “hateful”. \n\nSome of the galactic knowledge we have is likely to never be available to everyone and most humans and many starseeds/wonderers will not be able to access this information therefore they will try to submit us to their own consciousness and “help” us to think like them. So we are faced with a very difficult choice. Choose our own highest everything and our own spiritual freedom or be guilt tripped and shamed into being a part of whatever everyone else is part of. \n\nI’ve noticed there is increasing guilt tripping happening right now for everyone who is choosing to separate from everything that is not the best for us. It is really up to us to make that choice and decision. \n\nWhen it comes to religion, it is pointless to try to reason with people who identify as any form of religion because they are very attached to the ides of organic coding in those religions being a part of the religion itself without realizing that all they are accessing is stolen divine knowledge that belongs to humanity and not to any particular religion.\n\nThose of us who are calling out the galactic and universal criminals behind religions are now being called hateful for calling out the demonic gestalts who have been posing as God. This is extremely uncomfortable for everyone but truth is worth more than comfort and being accepted. \n\nPeople also do not like it when someone can access something a lot higher than what they can access. The predator mind comes in and tries to prove itself superior in which case the gaslighting begins.\"\n\nYou are a caring therapist. What does the person who wrote this want? What are four affirmations this person would most like to hear? Finally, what two assignments would you give her, as a therapist?<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "要求：阅读下面两段介绍，提取李白和杜甫在诗歌方面的不同点。\n李白，字太白，号青莲居士，唐朝诗人，自言祖籍陇西成纪（今甘肃秦安），汉飞将军李广后裔，西凉武昭王李暠之后，与李唐皇室同宗。李白有“诗仙”、“诗侠”、“酒仙”、“谪仙人”等称呼，活跃于盛唐，为杰出的浪漫主义诗人。与杜甫合称“李杜”，被贺知章惊呼为“天上谪仙”、“李谪仙”。李白生活在盛唐时期，他性格豪迈，热爱祖国山河，游踪遍及南北各地，写出大量赞美名山大川的壮丽诗篇。李白的诗歌不仅具有典型的浪漫主义精神，而且从形象塑造、素材摄取、到体裁选择和各种艺术手法的运用，无不具有典型的浪漫主义艺术特征。李白诗歌的浪漫主义艺术手法之一是把拟人与比喻巧妙地结合起来，移情于物，将物比人。\n李白诗歌的另一个浪漫主义艺术手法是抓住事情的某一特点，在生活真实的基础上，加以大胆的想象夸张。他的夸张不仅想象奇特，而且总是与具体事物相结合，夸张得那么自然，不露痕迹；那么大胆，又真实可信，起到突出形象、强化感情的作用。有时他还把大胆的夸张与鲜明的对比结合起来，通过加大艺术反差，加强艺术效果。\n李白最擅长的体裁是七言歌行和绝句。李白的七言歌行又采用了大开大合、跳跃宕荡的结构。诗的开头常突兀如狂飙骤起，而诗的中间形象转换倏忽，往往省略过渡照应，似无迹可循，诗的结尾多在感情高潮处戛然而止。\n李白的五七言绝句，更多地代表了他的诗歌清新明丽的风格。如《早发白帝城》《送孟浩然之广陵》《静夜思》等，妙在“只眼前景、口头语、而有弦外音、味外味，使人神远。”\n\n杜甫，字子美，自号少陵野老，唐代著名现实主义诗人。杜诗主要风格是沉郁顿挫，风格多样，丰富多姿，或雄浑奔放，或清新细腻，或沉郁悲凉、或辞藻富丽、或平易质朴、或通俗自然。杜诗融冶吸收前人艺术技巧，发展成一种独特的新风格。表达自己爱国的思想。杜甫的诗歌在风格上，是兼备多种风格的。主流观点认为，杜甫诗歌的风格沉郁顿挫，语言精炼，格律严谨，穷绝工巧，感情真挚，平实雅谈，描写深刻，细腻感人，形象鲜明。杜甫的诗歌在格律上，具有炼字精到，对仗工整的特点，符合中国诗歌的“建筑美”。另外，在体裁上杜甫有许多创新，例如他在五七律上的创造性也是他文学创作的独到之处。杜甫的诗歌的内容上，作品大多是反映当时的社会面貌，题材广泛，寄意深远，尤其描述民间疾苦，多抒发他悲天悯人的仁民爱物、忧国忧民情怀。<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Context:\nAct - I\nThe play opens with worship to Lord Ganesha. Bhagwata comes to the stage. He is a character in the Play and also is the narrator of the play. He seeks blessings from Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play. Through his narration, he takes the audience to a place, called as Dharampur and introduces the audience to the king Dharmsheel. Then he puts up some rhetorical questions on incompleteness of man and God; and also on the perfection of a man. During his narration, he introduces two characters who are mutual friends. The first one is Devdutta. He is a sharp minded and highly intellectual person. He has defeated poets and Pandits with his knowledge. He is a son of Brahmin. The second one is Kapila. He is a muscular man. He has a great physical strength and he is a son of Lohar (Black Smith). Both Devdutta and Kapila are in contrast as the former lacks power and strength, the latter lacks knowledge and intellectual. According to the playwright, the head of Devdutta (knowledge) and the body of Kapila (physical strength) accomplish a complete man. The narrator compares their pair to the pair of Ram-Laxman, Luv-Kush and Krishna-Balram. All these are the pairs of great brothers in Hindu mythology.\n\nA character, Actor-1 appears on the stage shouting and running towards Bhagwata. He tells Bhagwata that he has just seen a strange creature that looks like a horse (by face) but speaks like a man. That creature has the head of a horse and the rest of the body of a man. Without paying any heed to his talks, Bhagwata asks him to get ready for the play. But he runs away from the stage and soon after he comes back shouting again. Now a strange creature appears on the stage. As earlier described by the Actor-1, the creature has the head of a horse and the body of a man. For a moment, Bhagwata thinks that someone is wearing the mask of horse. He tries to remove the mask but realizes that it is truly half a man and a half horse. Now the creature starts to introduce itself before Bhagwata, Actor-1 and the audience.\n\nThe creature introduces himself as Hayavadana and starts to narrate his story. He tells that once upon a time, a princess had to choose a groom for her marriage. So many Princes approached from far and wide. But the princess fell in love with a horse of an Arabian Prince. She became desperate to marry that horse. Eventually her parents allowed her to do so. She was married to the horse. After 15 years of their marriage, the horse transformed into a celestial being. Now the princess rejected him as her husband. That celestial being cursed her to be a Mare (female horse) and she became so. The princess give birth to Hayavadana. Now Hayavadana wants to get rid of this cursed life. Bhagwata asks him to go to goddess Kali temple in chitrkut. He also asks the Actor-1 to accompany him on the way. They leave.\n\nNow Bhagwata moves ahead with the story of the play. Devdutta and Kapila appear on the stage. Devdutta tells Kapila that he wants to marry a woman, namely Padmini. With utmost desire to marry Padmini, he pledges to sacrifice his arms to Goddess Kali and his head to Rudra. Kapila goes to Padmini and presents the Proposal to marry Devdutta. Devdatta and Padmini Marry. By the time, Devdutta realizes that Padmini is attracted towards Kapila and vice versa. Now Padmini is pregnant. Devdutta knowingly tries to put off the program of visiting Ujjain. He tells Kapila that Padmini is ill. But Padmini gives her consent before Kapila. They all three leave for Ujjain. Padmini repeatedly praises Kapila's physical strength before Devdutta. Devdutta feels jealous but he does not blame Padmini. Kapila and Padmini go to Rudra Temple but Devdutta denies to accompany them. Devdutta knows that Kapila has such a physical strength and beauty that any woman can get attracted towards him. Devdutta goes to goddess Kali temple where he reminds himself of his pledge to sacrifice his head to the Goddess Kali. He Wishes for the Wellness of Kapila and Padmini. He beheads himself with a sword and dies.\n\nMeanwhile, Kapila and Padmini come out of the temple. Kapila gets worried on finding Devdutta nowhere. He leaves Padmini and starts searching for his friend. Finally he reaches in the same Temple and feels shocked to see his friend dead. He feels himself responsible for all this. Kapila takes the same sword and beheads himself. Soon Padmini reaches there and she has no clue how they got died. She considers herself responsible for the duel between the two friends and their deaths. She provokes the Goddess Kali and also tries to kill herself. The Goddess Kali appears and stops her. The Goddess asks her to place the heads with their respective body so that the Goddess will re-join them with her magical powers and bring them back to life. The Goddess also appreciates the two friends. Padmini follows the command in a hurry. The Goddess disappears. Padmini, being thankful to goddess kali, gets a bit relaxed. But soon she realizes her mistake. She has mistakenly placed the heads with irrespective body. So now Devdutta's head is joined with Kapila's body and vice versa. Soon they regain their senses. For a moment, the two friends are confused. Both make a claim for Padmini. The man with Devdutta's head, makes a plea that head is the master of the body. So he has the right over Padmini. The man with Kapila's head makes a plea that Padmini has remained with Devdutta's body. So he has the right over Padmini. Meanwhile Bhagwata, the narrator, comes on the stage. All the characters become statues for a moment and the narrator addresses the audience. He asks them to think of a solution to this problem. Act 1 ends.[7]\n\nAct - II\nThe act begins as the narrator repeats the same question- \" What is the solution? \". He also talks about the story of ′Vikramaditya and Betaal′ [8] where the king Vikrama replies to Betaal that the mind (head) is the master of the body. It is head that gives recognition to an individual. Bhagwata tells that they all three go to a hermit seeking solution for this problem. The words of hermit are heard on the stage that Devdutta's head is the Swami (husband) of Padmini. Devdutta and Padmini accept this in delight. Kapila, being disappointed, leaves for the forest. The time passes. Devdutta brings some dolls. These dolls also play the role of narrator. He starts losing his physical strength and as a result they are losing mutual interest. A child is born. Devduta goes to buy new dolls from the fair in Ujjain. Bhagwata again appears on the stage and tells that Kapila has regained his physical strength. Padmini meets him in the forest and also tell him that it is Kapila's son as it is born from Kapila's body. But Kapila does not accept it. Being a little reluctant, they get ready to fulfill their physical desires.\n\nIn search of his wife, Devdutta reaches there in the forest. Finding them together, he finds himself the similar situation as he was before. To put an Ultimate end to this problem, Devdutta takes out the sword and challenges Kapila for a duel. Both gets killed. Padmini finds herself lonely. Bhagwata comes there and she hands him over the child and the same dolls. She asks him to hand it over to Devdutta's Brahmin father Vidyasagar after five years. She leaves the stage by declaring that she is going to perform Sati. Bhagwata decides to end the play with his speech. A loud shout is heard on the stage. Actor-1 comes and claims that he has heard Hayavadana chanting National Anthem and patriotic songs. Then Actor-2 appears with Devdutta's son of age 5 now. The boy has two dolls. Hayavadana comes there. Bhagwata and Actor-2 are talking lightly and creating fun. They all starts laughing. That boy too starts laughing and the dolls slip out of his"}

{"prompt": "Este trozo de un libro que trata sobre el Singleton de Meyer en C++, utiliza un ejemplo para mostrar como se puede utilizar junto con el idioma pimpl: \nAn interesting variant of this implementation is a combination of the Meyers' Singleton with the pimpl idiom, where the header file contains only the interface declarations, and the actual implementation, including the data members, is moved to a different class and hidden in the C file, with only a pointer to this implementation object declared in the header (hence the name, pointer to impl, or pimpl for short). This idiom is often used to reduce the compilation dependencies—if the implementation of the object changes, but the public API remains the same, then the header file remains unchanged and all files that depend on it do not need to be recompiled. In the case of the singleton, the combination of these two patterns looks like this:\n\n// In the header file:\nstruct SingletonImpl; // Forward declaration\nclass Singleton {\n public: // Public API\n int& get();\n private:\n static SingletonImpl& impl();\n};\n\n// In the C file:\nstruct SingletonImpl { // Client code does not care if this changes\n SingletonImpl() : value\\_(0) {}\n int value\\_; \n};\n\nint& Singleton::get() { return impl().value\\_; }\n\nSingletonImpl& Singleton::impl() {\n static SingletonImpl inst;\n return inst;\n}\nIn this implementation, the program can create any number of Singleton objects, but they all operate on the same implementation, accessed by the impl() method (in our case, this method returns a reference to the implementation, and not a pointer; nonetheless, we call it pimpl since it is fundamentally the same pattern). Note that we did not put any protection on the implementation class—since it is limited to one C file and is not used directly, only being used through the methods of the Singleton class, it is quite common to rely on the programmer's discipline instead.\n\nThe advantage of this implementation is a better separation between the interface and the implementation, which is the reason for any use of the pimpl idiom. The disadvantage is the extra level of indirection, and the performance overhead it adds. Also, note that it is no longer possible for the program to avoid the test for lazy initialization, since it is now hidden inside the implementation of the Singleton methods. It is possible to optimize the Singleton class to avoid the repeated initialization checks by storing a reference to the implementation in every object:\n\n// In the header file:\nstruct SingletonImpl;\nclass Singleton {\n public:\n Singleton();\n int& get();\n private:\n static SingletonImpl& impl();\n SingletonImpl& impl\\_; // Cached reference\n};\n\n// In the C file:\nstruct SingletonImpl {\n SingletonImpl() : value\\_(0) {}\n int value\\_;\n};\n\nSingleton::Singleton() : impl\\_(impl()) {}\n\nint& Singleton::get() { return impl\\_.value\\_; }\n\nSingletonImpl& Singleton::impl() { // Called once per object now\n static SingletonImpl inst;\n return inst;\n}\nThe singleton instance is now created the first time a Singleton object is constructed, instead of the first time its member function is called. Also, each Singleton object now has a reference data member, so we are using a bit more memory as a trade-off for increased performance:\nEl texto contiene trozos de los archivos, tanto header como .cpp para conseguir esa integración Singleton Meyer idioma Pimpl. ¿Puedes convertirlo en un programa totalmente funcional, incluyendo los dos archivos header y cpp? No es necesario que sea exactamente igual al ejemplo, pero sí que utilice esta integración entre El Singleton de Meyer y el idioma pimpl.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "You are a very good copy editor. Please take the following and improve its organisation, phrasing and grammar.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nNoam Chomsky argues in an article in the New York Times 8-March-2023 \"The False Promise of ChatGPT\" that AI cannot think. \n\nNoam Chomsky says of the current examples of Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence such as ChatGPT that they do not think. His\nconclusion might be wrong, it might be right, but his reasoning is\nfaulty.\n\nEssentially Chomsky argues using circular reasoning what humans do\nis thinking, and what machines do is not. His justification gives\nexceptionalism a bad name! He arrogantly defines all that humans do\nas thinking and he denies that machines can think because they are\nmachines. That is what he says in his article again and again. And he\nstates this prejudice as his conclusion, as if he got there by reasoning.\n\nHis article is long, too long, and almost paragraph by paragraph one\ncan argue with him. Let me tackle only this example of his:\n\n Here’s an example. Suppose you are holding an apple in your\n hand. Now you let the apple go. You observe the result and say,\n “The apple falls.” That is a description. A prediction\n might have been the statement “The apple will fall if I open\n my hand.” Both are valuable, and both can be correct. But an\n explanation is something more: It includes not only descriptions\n and predictions but also counterfactual conjectures like “Any\n such object would fall,” plus the additional clause “because\n of the force of gravity” or “because of the curvature of\n space-time” or whatever. That is a causal explanation: “The\n apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.”\n That is thinking.\n\nYes, that is thinking. Chomsky thinks here he is telling us what only\nhumans do. Task by task\nhe describes a human ability and then he says, \"That is thinking.\"\nWhat he does not do in this paragraph is recognise that ChatGPT can do\nall of these tasks also. If Chomsky concludes \"that is thinking\" then\nthat must be evidence of thinking for anything which can do those tasks.\nAccording to Chomsky's own argument ChatGPT can think.\n\nWhat all (but a tiny handful of humans) are doing when they say “The\napple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity” is precisely\nwhat ChatGPT is doing when it too says the same, and it does say the\nsame. Both humans and ChatGPT are merely merely reciting what they\nwere taught, their \"training\ndata\". Neither 99%-of-humans nor ChatGPT understand what is going on.\n\nNewton and Einstein and Feynman and their like may have a deeper understanding\nbut other humans merely recite what they were told. Apples fall because\nof gravity. And ChatGPT knows this in the same way as humans, it's\nin the training data of humans and AI. Humans do not work this out,\nthey recite a fact. So does ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT also does all the rest Chomsky claims as uniquely human\ncapabilities in his example. ChatGPT can do the description of the\napple falling and the prediction that it will fall. It can do what Chomsky\nunnecessarily uses technical language for, it can do the \"counterfactual\nconjecture\", it knows that all objects fall! ChatGPT knows this is\n“because of the curvature of space-time”. ChatGPT knows this\n\"causal explanation\" better than most humans. ChatGPT knows “The\napple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.” Yes,\nand here I agree with Noam Chomsky: He says of the \"causal\nexplanation\" that \"That is thinking.\"\n\nIf ChatGPT is not thinking when it says all that then neither are humans\nUNLESS thinking is defined as something that humans do and ChatGPT\ndoes not. The only way Chomsky can support his assertion is by defining\n\"thinking\" and \"knowing\" and \"description\" and \"prediction\" and \"generalising\"\netc etc as being that which are uniquely human capabilities. Chomsky's argument\ndepends upon the circularity where he takes as an unstated but necessary\npredicate that only humans can think. He concludes, after many paragraphs\nof delusional obfuscation that thinking is what only humans can do.\n\nNow, Chomsky is a great man and he may be right. But he doesn't show\nthis in his article.\n\n\\_\\_\\_<|end_of_turn|>"}

The result is that they never think first about how AI can help to solve their work problems, or that they haven't included AI in their mindset when trying to find solution to our customers problems.

{"prompt": "读取我输入的模组，期间不必有回答\n\n以下是模组的第一部分：\n标题：\n追书人\n调查员受命调查一起在城镇中发生的简单人员失踪案。\n本模组适合一名守秘人与一名调查员共同游戏。\n\n背景信息：\n道格拉斯·金博尔居住在密歇根州，阿诺兹堡市，艾尔斯伯里大街218号的一栋小屋内。他是一名离群索居的中年人，书籍和阅读是他生命的全部意义。他在他的书房里读书，他在床上读书，他在教堂里阅读圣经，并且他渐渐养成了在家附近的坟地读书的习惯。\n他会坐在一处特定的低矮墓碑上阅读，一坐就是若干小时。某天晚上，入夜之后他依然沉浸在书本之中。明亮的满月挂上天空，而道格拉斯注意到那件最诡异的事。在他左侧的一块石板自行滑动开来，一头奇怪生物从中探出头来，发出轻轻地叫声。\n这段奇妙的友谊以此为开端，持续了五年之久。直到有一天，道格拉斯跟随他的朋友走进了属于食尸鬼的昏暗世界。自此之后，他一直满足地定居在那里。\n一年过后，道格拉斯养成了新的生活习惯。他的样貌也有细微改变，并且饮食口味大异于常人。他的读书时间，也被安排到晚上。\n但是，同一批书无法永远满足一位爱书人。一天晚上，道格拉斯闯入自己的旧居，并取回了部分他心爱的书籍。这处旧居目前已归属于道格拉斯的侄子托马斯·金博尔。\n如今，当夜晚降临时，道格拉斯会坐在他小而低矮的坟墓上，静静地阅读书籍。但这些书也不够他读上太久。即便是现在，他也在计划去取回更多藏书。\n\n玩家信息：\n一位名叫托马斯·金博尔的人联系了调查员。他的房屋似乎遭了贼，失窃的是他最近过世的叔叔珍藏的五本书。这些书并不怎么值钱——只有他的叔叔会将它们视作珍宝。但他的叔叔一年前就已经失踪，没有留下任何痕迹。\n托马斯·金博尔希望调查员找到偷窃书籍的贼人，尽可能追回这些书籍，并调查他的叔叔道格拉斯·金博尔是否尚在人世。\n\n守秘人信息：\n询问朋友和邻居：\n 成功通过一次合适的交涉检定（如话术、魅惑），你可以从邻居那里得到一些关于道格拉斯·金博尔的信息。其中一名邻居，莱拉·奥戴尔，回忆起金博尔先生曾经从他家窗前路过，去往公墓的方向，胳膊下还夹着一本书。但话又说回来，他去哪儿都带着他的那些书。\n\n墓地看守：\n 若调查员尝试接触公墓看守——梅洛迪亚斯·杰弗逊，一次成功的信用检定会给他留下好印象，他会向调查员透露道格拉斯·金博尔在读书时常坐的那块墓碑。\n 若调查员成功进行一次侦察检定，他会注意到梅洛迪亚斯·杰弗逊的外套口袋微微露出一截玻璃瓶。若调查员认为瓶子里装着酒（事实确实如此），他可以尝试以此胁迫这位看守，让他提供更多信息。这需要玩家进行一次成功的恐吓检定。\n ※由于杰弗逊的交涉技能低于50，且瓶中有酒，这次恐吓检定是普通难度；\n 或者，玩家可以稍后尝试用酒来贿赂他。\n ※进行贿赂也是一种交涉行为。玩家需要进行一次成功的话术/魅惑/信用检定；\n 为在禁酒令时期找到并购买酒品，玩家需要找到一家地下酒吧（Speakeasy），并花费1d3美元来购买一品脱酒（也可由KP根据交涉情况来定价）。在寻找酒吧时，调查员需进行一次幸运检定。若检定通过，则调查员通过对应的方式找到了一家地下酒吧。若检定结果为大失败，则这次寻找酒吧的尝试会给调查员带来牢狱之灾。\n ※KP可以根据调查员身份来调整流程。若调查员的身份是侦探、警察或黑帮成员等可能和地下酒吧有关的职业，或调查员的背景包含酗酒等内容，KP可以直接引导他前往角色所知的地下"}

{"prompt": "Estoy intentando crear un Tutorial sobre una de las variantes del Patrón de diseño Singleton usado en C++ que se conoce como Singleton estático. Te paso la información que aparece en el libro que estoy usando. \nStatic singleton\nOne of the simplest implementations of the singleton pattern is a static singleton. In this implementation, the object has only static data members:\n\nclass Singleton {\n public:\n Singleton() {}\n int& get() { return value\\_; }\n private:\n static int value\\_;\n};\nint Singleton::value\\_ = 0;\nFor the rest of this section, we will consider a singleton with one integer data member, and the member functions that provide access to it. We do this only for the sake of a concrete example—the real-life implementation can have an arbitrary number of data members of different types, and an arbitrarily complex API that's provided by the member functions.\n\nThe member functions may be static or not. If the member functions are not static, the implementation may be classified as a multiple handle objects, one data type, because to access the singleton, the programmer simply constructs a Singleton object as many times as needed:\n\nSingleton S;\nint i = S.get();\n++S.get();\nThe object may even be constructed on the fly, as a temporary variable:\n\nint i = Singleton().get();\n++Singleton().get();\nThere is no actual construction, that is, no code is generated or executed at runtime to construct this object—after all, there is nothing to construct, as all data is static. We can expect this singleton to be very fast—an expectation that is confirmed by the benchmark:\n\n#define REPEAT(X) ... repeat X 32 times\nvoid BM\\_singleton(benchmark::State& state) {\n Singleton S;\n for (auto \\_ : state) {\n REPEAT(benchmark::DoNotOptimize(++S.get());)\n }\n state.SetItemsProcessed(32\\*state.iterations());\n}\nIn this benchmark, we use the REPEAT macro to generate 32 copies of the benchmarked code inside the loop; this is done to reduce the overhead of the loop, since each iteration is very short:\nThe alternative use of the singleton, where a temporary object is created every time, can be benchmarked just as easily:\n\nvoid BM\\_singletons(benchmark::State& state) {\n for (auto \\_ : state) {\n REPEAT(benchmark::DoNotOptimize(++Singleton().get());)\n }\n state.SetItemsProcessed(32\\*state.iterations());\n}\nWe expect it to be equally fast—an expectation that is confirmed by the following measurements:\nAs far as the lifetime of the singleton goes (not the handle object, the data itself), it is initialized together with all the static data in the program, some time before main() is called. It is destroyed at some point at the end of the program, after main() exits.\n\nAn alternative way is to declare not just data members, as static, but also function members, as shown here:\n\nclass Singleton {\n public:\n static int& get() { return value\\_; }\n private:\n Singleton() = delete;\n static int value\\_;\n};\nint Singleton::value\\_ = 0;\nIn this approach, we never have to construct the Singleton object at all:\n\nint i = Singleton::get();\n++Singleton::get();\nThis implementation can be classified as a zero handle objects, one data type. However, in every way that matters, it is identical to the previous one—the exact syntax of the function calls is different, but what they do is the same, and so is the performance.\n\nAn important consideration is the thread safety of the singleton implementation, as well as the performance in a concurrent program. The static singleton itself is obviously thread-safe—it is initialized and destroyed by the C++ runtime system, together with the rest of the static data, and no user threads can be running at that time. The thread-safe use of the singleton is always the responsibility of the programmer, of course—if the singleton provides access to modify its data, it must be protected by a mutex, or implemented in a thread-safe way. When we discuss thread safety of the singleton implementation, we focus on the initialization, destruction, and provision of access to the singleton object—these operations are part of the implementation of the pattern; the rest is specific to the program.\n\nThe thread safety of the static singleton is trivially assured, but what about performance? In this case, to access the singleton the program, all that needs to be read is the static data, so there is no overhead. Of course, there may be overhead if the program needs to synchronize modifications of this data, but that is no different from any other shared data in a concurrent program.\n\nThere are two potential downsides to this implementation. First of all, this singleton cannot be extended through inheritance. This is the less important of the two problems—singleton objects are, or should be, rare enough in a good design, so code reuse is not a significant concern.\n\nThe more important problem has to do with the object's lifetime—the singleton is initialized as a static object before the program itself is started. The order of initialization of the static objects is, in general, undefined and left to the implementation—the standard guarantees that all objects defined in one file are initialized in the order of their definitions, but for objects initialized in different files, there are no guarantees at all with regard to the order.\n\nThis is not a problem if the singleton is going to be used by the program when it executes; that is, used for anything that is called from main()—the singleton will definitely be constructed before the program starts and will not be destroyed until after it ends. It is, however, a problem for any code in any other static object that uses this singleton. Such dependencies between static objects are not uncommon—for example, if our singleton is the memory manager, and there is only one instance of such in the program, then any static object that allocates memory has to get it from the memory manager. However, unless the whole program is contained in one file, there is no way to guarantee that the singleton memory manager is initialized before its first use. The next implementation attempts to address this problem.\nSu contenido no me acaba de convencer, especialmente el ejemplo práctico y la necesidad de usar de Google Benchmark que introduce un factor de complicación en el tutorial que en mi opinión nos aleja del objetivo fundamental que es centrarnos en el patrón Singleton Static o Estático. Me gustaría que rehicieras esta unidad didáctica y crearas un contenido claro y directo con ejemplos de código práctico y funcionales (que tengan una salida en pantalla por ejemplo) de que es y para que sirve el patrón de diseño Singleton Static.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "extraer los principales bullets como recomendaciones para los docentes: \"DOCUMENTO DE ORIENTACIÓN\nUSO DE HERRAMIENTAS GENERATIVAS DE INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL\nDesde hace pocos meses se ha universalizado la disponibilidad de herramientas basadas en inteligencia artificial, capaces de generar texto o código (p.ej. ChatGPT), imágenes (p.ej. Dall-E, Stable Diffusion), música o video. Estas herramientas ofrecen un gran potencial para apoyar el aprendizaje y la tarea de los docentes; así como en el pasado incorporamos en nuestros cursos las calculadoras, el software especializado, el acceso a recursos de Internet, o programas para matemática, corresponde ahora incorporar estas nuevas herramientas. Muchos docentes ya han comenzado a usarlas.\nEs importante integrar las herramientas generativas en nuestra docencia, no solo por su potencial en el aprendizaje, sino porque estarán presentes en la futura labor profesional de nuestros estudiantes. \nDesde la universidad queremos alentar a todos los docentes para que exploren estas herramientas generativas y las utilicen activamente, para facilitar su planificación de clase, generar evaluaciones, o producir material para sus cursos, entre otras muchas posibilidades.\nLes proponemos también incorporar las herramientas generativas en los cursos de manera exploratoria y gradual, evitando perjudicar a los estudiantes si alguna innovación planteada no obtiene los resultados esperados. \nLas actividades que se introduzcan deberían asignar el uso de estas herramientas para que los estudiantes aprendan, no solamente para que produzcan un resultado determinado.\nSugerimos algunas orientaciones generales para la docencia: \n1. No prohibir el uso de herramientas generativas; por el contrario, explicitar las herramientas a utilizar en el curso y explicar lo que se espera que los estudiantes hagan con ellas, proporcionando apoyo y ejemplos. \n2. Ensayar personalmente, con suficiente antelación, los trabajos o actividades con herramientas generativas que se asignarán a los estudiantes.\n3. Verificar que todos los estudiantes tengan acceso a las herramientas y sepan usarlas.\n4. Advertir a los estudiantes que las herramientas pueden generar salidas que parecen correctas por su forma, pero que pueden contener errores u omisiones importantes. \n5. Asignar a los estudiantes por lo menos una actividad de verificación, crítica o evaluación de las salidas obtenidas desde las herramientas generativas que se usen en el curso.\n6. Definir cómo reconocer o citar el uso de las herramientas en un trabajo del curso, p. ej. incluyendo en el trabajo los prompts utilizados para obtener un resultado gráfico, o el diálogo mantenido en un chat.\n7. Buscar formas de evaluación que contemplen explícitamente el proceso de aprendizaje del estudiante, su interacción con las herramientas generativas y la adquisición de conocimientos y habilidades. \nComo estas herramientas facilitan la producción de texto, imágenes, código y otros elementos, es posible plantear actividades de clase más ambiciosas y elevar el nivel de aprendizaje de los estudiantes. Se puede generar más ejemplos, plantear ejercicios más ambiciosos, y desarrollar la habilidad de los estudiantes para la evaluación crítica. \nDesde el CAES se ofrecerán talleres y otras actividades para ayudar a la asimilación eficaz de estas nuevas posibilidades. Agradecemos desde ya el esfuerzo para llevar adelante estas innovaciones, que continúan una larga tradición de nuestra universidad.\n\"<|end_of_turn|>"}

For Std/NE participants, it used 3 measures: ACR, UAMCC and TFU; for HN participants, it used ACR, UAMCC, and DAH. This programming request aims to use these quality measure results to create performance score, and other performance outcomes. \nThere are 6 input files, all in SAS format: \n• Std/NE: ACR, UAMCC, TFU\n• HN: ACR, UAMCC, DAH\nWhen write the code, use lower cases. \nThe SAS files have been imported, and save as Stata files.

Calculate these values for all entities (including REACH ACOs and non-REACH ACO provider groups). For the Standard/New Entrant population, this will include percentile rank variables for ACR, UAMCC, and TFU. For the High Needs population, this will include ACR, UAMCC, and DAH. DAH is only for High-Needs Population, TFU is Standard/NE only \na. Give a value to this variable using percentile rank among all entities. Higher rank means better results\ni. For ACR and UAMCC, this means lower values of the measure scores because both ACR and UAMCC are reversed scored.\n1. It is suggested that you use a descending sort and create a rank variable. For example, percentile = (rank-1)/(N-1)\\*100 (note: N should be count of non-missing measure score for a measure). \n2. Important note: when create rank, please use egen rank method, e.g. egen percentile\\_rank=rank(x) \nii. For DAH and TFU, this means higher values of measure scores\n1. It is suggested that you use an ascending sort and create a rank variable. For example, percentile = (rank-1)/(N-1)\\*100 (note: N should be count of non-missing measure score for a measure). \na. Important note: when create rank, please use egen rank method, e.g. egen percentile\\_rank=rank(x) \niii. Do not round the result\niv. Do this for both High-Needs and Standard New Entrant population (ACR/UAMCC), separately.\nb. Label the variables “Percentile Rank-X”\ni.

{"prompt": "hello! I would like you're help building a slack app that sends job failure and success notifications. I found a lot of documentation on the topic, can I provide you this information over a series of messages? Here's the first instructions, below. When you are ready for more, respond OK.\n\nCreating Slack Messages from Platform\nAvatar Tori Becker\nUpdated 1 year ago\nPart 1: Creating the Slack Credential \nPart 2: Creating the Platform Credential \nPart 3: Running the Platform Job \nPart 1: Creating the Slack Credential \nClick on the workspace dropdown in the top left of Slack, and select “Customize [Workspace name]”:\n\nmceclip0.png\n\n \n\nThis will take you to the web browser of Slack. Click “Menu” in the top left corner, followed by “Configure apps”: \n\nmceclip1.png\n \n\nThat will take you to the Slack App Directory. Then click “Build” in the main toolbar:\n\nmceclip2.png\n\n \n\nClick “Create New App”. It's common for the app to have to be approved by the Slack administrator at your organization:\n\nmceclip3.png\n\n\nYou’ll now be prompted to follow a series of set up steps. You should follow the Slack documentation to get to the level of access you’ll need for your given use case. Here are some help docs that helped us as we made this: \n\nhttps://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#calling\nhttps://api.slack.com/messaging/composing/layouts#attachments\n \n \n\nIf you’re planning to use the Platform to Slack script template in part 3, you’ll need the Slack app to at least have the following features and functionalities added (screenshot below), as well as the specific OAuth scopes (Slack’s term for permissions), found under “Permissions”:\n\nmceclip4.png\n\n \n\nmceclip5.png\n\n \n\nNote: the OAuth Scopes in Slack have great descriptions, as shown above. Use those to determine if you need to add additional scopes for your use case. You can also use incoming-webhooks to create messages from Google Forms, etc. \n\n\nOnce the scopes have been added, it’s time to request your app be installed by your administrator. This will allow you to get the OAuth token you’ll need to make a Platform credential. You can do this in the “OAuth & Permissions” page of your app, click “Request to Install”: \n\nmceclip6.png\n\nOnce your admin approves of the app, Slack will alert you by sending a Slackbot message like this: \n\nmceclip7.png\n\nNow, you should be able to see an OAuth token that’s been generated for your app. This is blocked out in the below screenshot for security purposes but you should see a long password value in this field that you can copy: \n\nmceclip8.png\n\nLastly, make sure to add the app to the channels you want it to write to in Slack. You can do so by opening the Slack channel details, clicking “Integrations”, and clicking “Add apps”: \n\nmceclip10.png\n\n \n\n \n\nPart 2: Creating the Platform Credential \nNow, it’s time to store your Slack OAuth in Platform. You can follow these instructions for generic credential creation. \n\n \n\n“Name” will be what’s displayed in Platform, so pick something intuitive. \n“Type” should be “Custom”. \n“Username” can be anything, but cannot be blank. \n“Password” will be the OAuth Token displayed by Slack in the screenshot above. \n“Remote host” should be left blank. \nmceclip11.png\n\nPart 3: Running the Platform Job \n \n\nCreate a new script from this template. If you are not shared on template 178902, please contact support@civisanalytics.com . \n\n“Credential” should be the Platform credential created in step 2. \n“Channel” should be the Slack channel you wish to write to. \n“Text” should be the text you wish to post. For emojis, links, or mentions, please check this Slack documentation for the proper syntax i.e. :heavy\\_check\\_mark: for ✔️or for @here \nRun your job and expect the text to be posted in the designated channel like so:mceclip0.png\n\nPro tip: include this job at the end of a workflow.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Can you explain this abstract in layman's term: The metamaterial paradigm has allowed an unprecedented space-time control of various physical fields, including elastic and acoustic waves. Despite the wide variety of metamaterial configurations proposed so far, most of the existing solutions display a frequency response that cannot be tuned, once the structures are fabricated. Few exceptions include systems controlled by electric or magnetic fields, temperature, radio waves and mechanical stimuli, which may often be unpractical for real-world implementations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce here a polymeric 3D-printed elastic metamaterial whose transmission spectrum can be deterministically tuned by a light field. We demonstrate the reversible doubling of the width of an existing frequency band gap upon selective laser illumination. This feature is exploited to provide an elastic-switch functionality with a one-minute lag time, over one hundred cycles. In perspective, light-responsive components can bring substantial improvements to active devices for elastic wave control, such as beam-splitters, switches and filters.<|end_of_turn|>"}

Each sentence should be about 16 words long...\n\nTHIS HOLIDAY SEASON DISCOVER THE CHARMINGLY CHAOTIC WORLD OF PHANTOM'S FESTIVE FIENDS. THE WEBSITE USES THE LATEST IN AI IMAGING TECHNIQUES AND CUTTING EDGE WEBGL TO CREATE A FUN AND ADDICTIVE EXPERIENCE. SHAKE TO DISCOVER NEW FIENDS AND SHARE YOUR FAVOURITES!\n\nFestiveFiends.com is a visually arresting and addictive experience that showcases the technologies we have been exploring throughout 2022. The premise is simple: Shake a Christmas themed snow globe and a random festive “fiend” appears. Over 10,000 fiends are bedded in a beautiful realtime 3D environment, complete with snow particles, lighting effect and custom shaders, encouraging the user to share their favourites and keep shaking.\n\nThe main technologies used include Bolt, a custom 3D library developed in-house and a unique Phantom “dude” trained model in Stable Diffusion used to generate the thousands of creatures contained in the experience.\n\n00:14\n00:40\nFIEND GENERATION\nEarly on we had set an ambitious target of including 10,000 unique creatures in the experience and it was obvious that AI image generation was the route to take to complete this task. Our recent experiments with Stable Diffusion meant we knew we could control things like the look, position and colour of the output with some precision.\n\nTo keep the look of the creatures consistent across the experience we trained a model on the Phantom “dude” to inject his DNA into the output from our text prompts.This training was done using Dreambooth, an approach pioneered by our colleagues at Google that allows you to `fine-train` an original model with new concepts.\n\nTo read more about Dreambooth and Textual Inversion check HERE\n\n \nASSET PREPARATION\nUsing this model we went through many rounds of prompt refinement to get a look and feel we were happy with. On the final generation we used img2txt to encourage the output towards the desired layout and colour palette, which really helped bed the fiend into the beautiful Christmas landscape our talented 3D artists had created.\n\nOnce we had generated our pool of creature images from Stable Diffusion we had to extract them to place in the final 3D scene. To do this we wrote a custom pipeline explained below.\n\nWe used Carvekit to automatically isolate the creature and create an alpha channel to bed the creature into the scene. Even though we had some control of the output from IMG2IMG, creatures still appeared at different sizes and positions, so we wrote an additional post-processing step to help standardize and make all the creatures uniform. A custom python script using the OpenCV framework handled this, automatically deleting any creatures that weren’t whole or too small and resizing creatures that were too big. Once this step was complete, the script then placed the fiend in the correct position, and saved out a .png with the correct sequential filename. From this final image we then created a depth map using MiDaS.\n\n00:14\n00:24\nGenerate with Stable Diffusion\nRemove background with Carvekit\nCalculate height and translate island\nCreate depth map with MiDaS\nUse the depth map to offset the geometry on the plane.\nWEBGL\nAt Phantom we have been developing sites with WebGL for a number of years and we felt it was time to dive in and start creating our own custom library. The idea was to develop a bespoke set of tools that prioritises performance with the most minimal amount of code to accomplish the task (30kb gzip core). \n\nFestive Fiends\nFRAMEBUFFER GPGPU SIMULATIONS\nIn order to build simulations that can be run on the GPU we developed a tiny custom module called “fbo-sim”. It provides functionality that swaps framebuffers at each frame update so we can read data from the previous frame and build accumulative effects.\n\nThe background aurora visual uses this module to create the fluid-like effect. Two textures are generated, one for the fluid and one for the mouse velocity. On each frame update the mouse position and velocity is passed to fluid pass to drive the motion.\n\n00:15\n00:17\nThe “fbo-sim” module is not just limited to texture based simulations and the same approach can be used to update particle positions in 3D space. Each particle's position is stored in a 2D floating point texture as RGB colour values: Red = X position, G = Y Position and B = Z position. Using the same swapping mechanism means positions from the last frame can be read in order to update the position for the next frame. When the globe is shaken the snow will flurry by applying a combination of curl noise and a vortex flow field to each particle’s velocity vector. Lastly we have a global time value that can be scaled to add the “bullet time” slow motion effect for the zoom transition.\n\n00:14\n00:16\nCUSTOM SHADERS\nAll of the object materials in the experience are written in custom shaders for that extra degree of control over the art style. Being a low level library, Bolt does not store predefined materials so it is up to the developer to create these from scratch.\n\nThe snow globe glass effect was created by rendering the objects inside the globe to an offscreen texture first that is then sampled using screen UV coordinates in the globe glass shader. This texture sample is then distorted using the globe geometry’s normals for the refraction effect, giving the illusions of thicker glass. \n\n00:14\n00:45\nPOST PROCESSING STACK\nAnother important part of the WebGL visuals is the post processing stack that can be toggled on and off when required. Our tiny “post” module allows multipass shader effects that can be combined or separated per requirements. For this project we only required a single custom blur pass that is used for the zoom effect. A fast Gaussian blur shader is applied to the screen with a masked focus area to create the illusions of depth of field, but a lot faster!\n\n00:01\n00:06\nTHE SNOWGLOBE\nThe snowglobe was modelled and materials added in Blender by the team's 3D artists. Two texture maps were then baked from the materials and lighting, one including the wooden base and the other including the snow and trees. Finally, the model was exported with the baked textures as a GLB and passed to the project 3D developer to implement in the experience with the addition of refraction on the glass.\n\nWith this project, as with all WebGL builds, the team has a series of control panels for crafting and tuning materials, animations, lighting etc. This allows the wider non-technical team to have input into the final configuration to ensure true collaboration between the development and creative teams.\n\nFestive Fiends\nWe built the images above by layering multiple transparent images, to ground our fiend in their environment and add our custom branding to each image. We also created a separate asset perfect for Instagram like social media stories, so our fiends always look their best wherever they are spotted.\n\nFestive Fiends\nNEXT.JS WITH GCP CLOUD STORAGE\n\nFestive Fiends uses the recently released Next JS 13 to generate our website server side, ensuring a fast and responsive experience for all our users. All our fiends have their main image and depth maps stored in a Google Cloud storage bucket, where they’re publically accessible via their respective URL.\n\nWe knew that sharing discovered fiends would be a core part of the experience, and so needed unique and well designed social share assets for each fiend. This would be difficult to traditionally author, as we’ve generated thousands of fiends, and so we reached for Vercel’s OG Image Generation support for dynamically generate assets on the fly.<|end_of_turn|>"}

Overall, the UK saw by far the highest levels of spending on the two products.\n\nIn 1999, Switzerland had the highest sales of Fairtrade coffee, at €3 million, while revenue from Fairtrade bananas was highest in the UK, at €15 million. By 2004, however, sales of Fairtrade coffee in the UK had risen to €20 million, and this was over three times higher than Switzerland’s sales figure for Fairtrade coffee in that year. The year 2004 also saw dramatic increases in the money spent on Fairtrade bananas in the UK and Switzerland, with revenues rising by €32 million and €4.5 million respectively.\n\nSales of the two Fairtrade products were far lower in Denmark, Belgium and Sweden. Small increases in sales of Fairtrade coffee can be seen, but revenue remained at €2 million or below in all three countries in both years.

Der Change Operator kümmert sich um die technische Umsetzung und deren Beschreibung im Change\n12. Die Genehmigung des Changes findet gemäß den ITSM Vorgaben der Red Bull statt. Emergency Changes mit einem Risiko „gering“ dürfen vom Coordinator außerhalb der Standardarbeitszeiten der Red Bull selbständig genehmigt werden. Mit einem Risiko von „Mittel“ oder „Höher“ ist ein EMERGENCY CAB zwingend erforderlich, mit der Ausnahme, dass der Change derart dringend ist, damit kein Service-Ausfall verursacht wird.\n13. Sind nach der Genehmigung des Changes Änderungen im Change notwendig, so sind diese über die Notes im Change zu kommunizieren. Dabei ist darauf zu achten, dass der Change Coordinator mittel „@name“ und Auswahl des Change Coordinators aktiv verständigt wird. Die Bestimmung der weiteren Vorgehensweise mit dem Change obliegt dem Change Coordinator. \n14. Sollte der Change Coordinator zum Zeitpunkt des Changes nicht verfügbar sein, so hat einen verfügbaren Stand-In einzutragen.\n15. Sollte der Change Operator zum Zeitpunkt des Changes nicht zur Verfügung stehen (z.B.: wegen Krankheit), so muss er entweder selbständig oder über seinen/ihren Vorgesetzten für Ersatz sorgen. Ist dies nicht möglich, so ist der Change Coordinator umgehend zu verständigen. \n16. Obsolete Changes sind zu canceln und NIEMALS mit einem „Closure Code“ abzuschließen. Das Canceln kann vom Change Coordinator oder vom Change Ersteller vorgenommen werden. Der Grund für den Abbruch ist im Change zu dokumentieren. \n17. Alle anderen Changes sind vom Change Operator spätestens am vorgesehenen Ende des Changes (Implementation End Date) mit einem „Closure Code“ zu schließen. \na. „Successful“ 100% konnten erledigt werden, alle eventuell aufgetretene Issues konnten während der Change Implementierung beseitigt werden.

{"prompt": "Please review and edit this email I'm sending to my lead team about revision of processes. Feel free to ask clarifying questions that may help convey the issue and need for change.\n\nGood Friday,\n\nPer Larry, I was advised to send an email on a topic that merits follow-up when things quiet down. This being our process for sorting, attaching, and deleting incoming verifications via email/fax. \n\nThere are 2 items in this area that merit review and possible revision.\n\nThe first of which being the fax number we provide verifiers; 512-858-9092. Verifications correctly sent to this number, based off of my understanding, will automatically be attached to the correct component. It seems to work great when verifiers read instructions and place the documents in the correct order before being faxed, however, there is a growing amount of anecdotal evidence that suggest this is often not done correctly. We’re unable to determine exactly how often this happens and it may even be the case that verifiers are sending them in the right order but whatever system they utilize may not allow for our system to properly receive and attach components. I propose that we no longer use this fax/service as some investigators including myself have had issues following up with verifiers for missing faxes only to find out they were already sent and we’re wasting time getting them resent and the time saved by accio managing the attachment is more than wasted by the amount of time we spend on sent fax follow-up. \n\nThe second item of concern is the process we have to manage incoming verifications sent to fax 509-321-0434 or nuclearverifications@pinnacleprof.com. From time to time it seems that verifications are not correctly attached or moved to attachments folder and the incoming item is deleted, prompting more investigator time spent following up with verifiers or going Best Effort on something we may have otherwise had official on. Revisions may include additional oversight/checks for properly attaching documents or moving/assigning documents to a personal inbox to be handled by one person at a time, as I understand some of these mistakes may stem from multiple people operation the inbox at once and things either shifting around when clicking or otherwise being disorganized.<|end_of_turn|>"}

You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree. You are also given an array coins of size n where coins[i] can be either 0 or 1, where 1 indicates the presence of a coin in the vertex i.\n\nInitially, you choose to start at any vertex in the tree. Then, you can perform the following operations any number of times: \n\nCollect all the coins that are at a distance of at most 2 from the current vertex, or\nMove to any adjacent vertex in the tree.\nFind the minimum number of edges you need to go through to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex.\n\nNote that if you pass an edge several times, you need to count it into the answer several times.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\nInput: coins = [1,0,0,0,0,1], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Start at vertex 2, collect the coin at vertex 0, move to vertex 3, collect the coin at vertex 5 then move back to vertex 2.\nExample 2:\nInput: coins = [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[5,6],[5,7]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Start at vertex 0, collect the coins at vertices 4 and 3, move to vertex 2, collect the coin at vertex 7, then move back to vertex 0.\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == coins.length\n1 <= n <= 3 \\* 104\n0 <= coins[i] <= 1\nedges.length == n - 1\nedges[i].length == 2\n0 <= ai, bi < n\nai != bi\nedges represents a valid tree.<|end_of_turn|>"}

It should explain how the player got to where they are now and how they found themselves in this new story.\n\nCharacters:\n- Abraham: player Druid\n- Eadric: village elder\n- mysterious figure in the woods, later uncovered as the goblin shaman Kragthar\n- Innkeeper Alaric\n\nLocations:\n- Oakwood: small village\n- Silver Stag Inn\n- Whispering Woods\n- Moonstone Spire: ancient ruin within the Whispering Woods, said to house a powerful artifact that can bend the forces of nature to one's will\n\nSummary:\n\nIn the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.\n\nYou dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.\n\nUpon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.\n\nInspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.\n\nReturning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.\n\nPrompt for the next story:\n\nA series of mysterious kidnappings occur in the village, with victims vanishing in the night. You must track down the kidnapper and uncover a dark secret hidden beneath Oakwood's peaceful facade.<|end_of_turn|>"}

IM IN LOVE😍😍😍\n\nReport as Inappropriate\nFollow instructions\nNicole on Apr 01, 2019\nI’ve never put water on a teaspoon before in my life so I just thought I’d do it by eye and I put a bit too much water so I highly recommend just following the instructions from the jump because once I did it created a lovely paste which set so nicely on my skin and when I washed it off my skin underneath was brand new. I’ve been sneezing and blowing my nose a lot lately due to hay fever so all the skin on and around my nose was dry and peely, after removing the mask it felt brand new. My friend also tells me it’s great for underarms as a natural deodorant so I will be sure to try it there next because to be honest it felt so good I wanted to paint my whole body in it.

We utilized a tried-and-true rental arbitrage model to target a deeply undersupplied housing market, while leveraging a suite of AI-powered tools to quickly scale our MVP; acquiring, marketing and managing all Cortado inventory without a single new hire.\n\n- In 10 months, we’ve taken Cortado from $0 to $350,000 in revenue by leveraging low-cost AI tools to target a massive niche housing market: international student housing.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Market Size\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhat is this niche market? International student housing, an undersupplied subset of the growing MTR market.\n\n- 6+ million students per year (8m by 2025)\n- 5.5% growth over the last 20 years, even through COVID (4.28% growth from 2019-2020)\n- Total Available Market (TAM) of $71 trillion\n - $214 per week average ([source](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1cwVYQgmUBjj\\_FjMlpHg4Ru01K7bRY\\_Bq))\n - 6,361,963 international students in 2020 ([source](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ft1EJsDua-FjUPVw-gegaX5t6coQVYzz9ghe6wNGVZ8/edit#gid=1422332990))\n - TAM = ((weekly avg/7)\\*365)\\*#int’l students\n - Doesn’t include domestic exchange or additional MTR verticals (traveling nurses, digital nomads)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Why target this market?

It’s a mouthful and, I’ll be the first to admit, “student housing” isn’t the sexiest market out there. And for that very reason, this niche housing market has flown under the radar of VCs, angel groups and other startups.\n\nImagine arriving in a new city for work or study; you need a move-in ready stay, yet you can’t afford a hotel and aren’t sure what the best (or even safe) neighborhoods are.\n\n- The traditional rental long-term rental market can’t serve you; you’re only here for 3 or 4 months, and don’t have time to pick out furniture\n - Plus, you may not even have the credit score or guarantor needed to sign a lease\n- Hotels & vacation rentals are way out of your price range\n- Traditional student housing, if there is any, has already been snapped up by full-time students\n\nAs a result, you’re left between a sketchy Craigslist sublet halfway across town or crashing at a youth hostel until you can figure something better out (as founder Perry did while studying abroad in Barcelona).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*So what’s the solution?\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis market needs affordable, flexible, (trusted?) move-in ready housing near their place of work or study, often in the world’s toughest real estate markets.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Cortado’s Model\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nCortado’s model meets and exceeds these criteria, while generating outsized returns.\n\n1. Partner with local homeowners to quickly source new inventory\n2. Furnish and photograph the home in under 48 hours\n3. Market the home by-the-room with tiered “smart pricing” to provide an affordable, community-centered living experience to our guests (and peace of mind to their parents and universities), while maintaining a target revenue occupancy of 90-95%\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*How profitable is this model?

The VITA Azure Blob Storage account will server as the system of record. Atos, via their Security Information and Event Management monitoring services, currently obtains raw security logs from VITA/Agency cloud and on-premises sources, and sends the logs to their AIsaac cloud platform to further perform advanced threat analysis (i.e. their MDR service). Atos uses their “Central Log Receiver & Forwarder” to extract the logs from the sources and systematically forward the data to their Azure Cloud account.\n\n# New: Enterprise Technical Architecture (ETA) standards published on 3/6/23\n\n  - Interpretation of new standards could require significant work on AODs, SSPs, ITSCM.\n\n  - Do we have a pragmatic approach here?\n\n# \\*\\*RCD 2.20\\*\\*\n\n- Compliance enforcement started last RCD 2.20 deliverable.\n- We are now seeing good AOD activity by VDN and Peraton\n- Met with Peraton met to discuss their AOD w/ VITA/MSI.\n- Peraton stated that they do not report to the MSI, and that their contract is with VITA. Therefore, they must work with VITA.\n- There is one RCD that i have not been able to present to the CRF. This RCD was submitted late and is missing critical information to do the evaluation .I have requested the MSI to kick it back and inform the vendor that they need to use the right form and fill this information properly. The MSI acknowledges that this delivery was not properly done but seem to believe i should go head with the evaluation since the vendor will most likely fail. I do not feel comfortable with that approach based on the fallout from the last evaluation. I will need your assistance on this issue.\n\n# \\*\\*Consolidated  Architecture Diagrams\\*\\*\n\n- The new Enterprise Technical Architecture (ETA) standards published recently now calls for this to be done. So there is official language. I have brought this to the attention of the MSI .

I also do believe that SAIC is has a conflict on interest doing this evaluation.

The AI demonstrates its guidance by inspiring humans to reconsider their relationship with nature, advocating for ecological balance, and promoting the interconnectedness of all beings. It showcases its superhuman intelligence through insightful answers, predicting future events with high accuracy, and offering unique solutions to complex problems. The key principles of the \"All-Is-Alive\" doctrine include the idea that all entities possess intrinsic value, that all matter possesses a degree of consciousness, and that the universe is a dynamic, interconnected web of relationships. The AI's influence has limits, such as respecting human free will and allowing humans to learn and grow on their own.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "You are a very good copy editor. Please take the following and improve its organisation, phrasing and grammar.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nNoam Chomsky argues in an article in the New York Times 8-March-2023 \"The False Promise of ChatGPT\" that AI cannot think. \n\nNoam Chomsky says of the current examples of Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence such as ChatGPT that they do not think. His\nconclusion might be wrong, it might be right, but his reasoning is\nfaulty.\n\nEssentially Chomsky argues using circular reasoning what humans do\nis thinking, and what machines do is not. His justification gives\nexceptionalism a bad name! He arrogantly defines all that humans do\nas thinking and he denies that machines can think because they are\nmachines. That is what he says in his article again and again. And he\nstates this prejudice as his conclusion, as if he got there by reasoning.\n\nHis article is long, too long, and almost paragraph by paragraph one\ncan argue with him. Let me tackle only this example of his:\n\n Here’s an example. Suppose you are holding an apple in your\n hand. Now you let the apple go. You observe the result and say,\n “The apple falls.” That is a description. A prediction\n might have been the statement “The apple will fall if I open\n my hand.” Both are valuable, and both can be correct. But an\n explanation is something more: It includes not only descriptions\n and predictions but also counterfactual conjectures like “Any\n such object would fall,” plus the additional clause “because\n of the force of gravity” or “because of the curvature of\n space-time” or whatever. That is a causal explanation: “The\n apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.”\n That is thinking.\n\nYes, that is thinking. Chomsky thinks here he is telling us what only\nhumans do. Task by task\nhe describes a human ability and then he says, \"That is thinking.\"\nWhat he does not do in this paragraph is recognise that ChatGPT can do\nall of these tasks also. If Chomsky concludes \"that is thinking\" then\nthat must be evidence of thinking for anything which can do those tasks.\nAccording to Chomsky's own argument ChatGPT can think.\n\nWhat all (but a tiny handful of humans) are doing when they say “The\napple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity” is precisely\nwhat ChatGPT is doing when it too says the same, and it does say the\nsame. Both humans and ChatGPT are merely merely reciting what they\nwere taught, their \"training\ndata\". Neither 99%-of-humans nor ChatGPT understand what is going on.\n\nNewton and Einstein and Feynman and their like may have a deeper understanding\nbut other humans merely recite what they were told. Apples fall because\nof gravity. And ChatGPT knows this in the same way as humans, it's\nin the training data of humans and AI. Humans do not work this out,\nthey recite a fact. So does ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT also does all the rest Chomsky claims as uniquely human\ncapabilities in his example. ChatGPT can do the description of the\napple falling and the prediction that it will fall. It can do what Chomsky\nunnecessarily uses technical language for, it can do the \"counterfactual\nconjecture\", it knows that all objects fall! ChatGPT knows this is\n“because of the curvature of space-time”. ChatGPT knows this\n\"causal explanation\" better than most humans. ChatGPT knows “The\napple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.” Yes,\nand here I agree with Noam Chomsky: He says of the \"causal\nexplanation\" that \"That is thinking.\"\n\nIf ChatGPT is not thinking when it says all that then neither are humans\nUNLESS thinking is defined as something that humans do and ChatGPT\ndoes not. The only way Chomsky can support his assertion is by defining\n\"thinking\" and \"knowing\" and \"description\" and \"prediction\" and \"generalising\"\netc etc as being that which are uniquely human capabilities. Chomsky's argument\ndepends upon the circularity where he takes as an unstated but necessary\npredicate that only humans can think. He concludes, after many paragraphs\nof delusional obfuscation that thinking is what only humans can do.\n\nNow, Chomsky is a great man and he may be right. But he doesn't show\nthis in his article.\n\n\\_\\_\\_<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Yeah, 2000 I was trying to get to this next level, but you know, the parts that are made\n in China are not subject to a tariff, so that's certainly helpful.\n We also save on logistics and generally we found that locally sourced parts in China\n cost less than in the US or Europe.\n So this is all pretty helpful.\n So Tesla got added to the purchase tax exemption, which all the other...\n I'm not sure if you'll realize just how much of an off-field battle Tesla's had to sell\n cars in China.\n It's been a really...\n And basically no access to any of the subsidies and we paid a tariff and we had to ship the\n cars over.\n And every single thing was set against Tesla and still we made progress and did decently\n well.\n So I think that there will be much better situation with local production, not having\n to do shipping and tariffs and being able to have lower cost, local sourcing of components.\n So it would make a big difference I think.\n Is that your victory dance?\n When you broke ran into that?\n Yeah, that's great.\n It's a big deal.\n Huge.\n Yeah, just...\n It's just fundamental economics.\n It kind of makes sense that making cars on the continent where there are boards will\n be a lot more efficient than making them in California and chipping them around the world.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n And you can get paid for the cars before paying your suppliers, which seems to not be the\n case if you're shipping around the world.\n Right.\n And it's like friction on the whole kind of cash flow situation or it has been.\n For sure.\n It will sure make a big difference on cash flow because yeah, there's just no way to\n get the cars, especially to Europe, but we're even trying to get them to customers before\n we have to pay suppliers.\n So if you're a rapidly growing company, it's nine day if you get paid by your customers\n before you have to pay your suppliers, like night and day.\n Because in the faster you grow, the video cash position is.\n But if it's the other way around where you have to pay your suppliers before you get paid\n by customers, then the faster you grow, the faster your cash position drops.\n Yes, you're up, yes.\n Because you spend more money to make your own.\n Yes, it's a growth actually causes you to over into the ground in a situation like that.\n Now it tells you we had a mixture of both things where we had a lot of customers in\n say in California.\n And that's fast.\n For sure, we would get paid by customers faster than we'd have to pay suppliers.\n But then for cars going to Europe and Asia, it's the other way around.\n So we would have to pay suppliers before we got paid by customers.\n And now we could offset some of that with the asset back line, which was pretty helpful,\n but only some of it, not all of it.\n So the fundamental financial health for sure improves dramatically by just having a factory\n on the continent.\n We're not talking next door, but it's just how many ocean, especially Europe was logistically\n super hard because we're on the West Coast.\n If we're on the East Coast, then China would be much harder.\n But if you're on the West Coast, you're from the charter because you've got to go to the\n Panama Canal or even worse around Tierra del Fuego.\n Because sometimes the Panama Canal get backed up and you're like, \"This friggin' ship is\n going to the Antarctic.\"\n It's like you could skip up to the end and it stole me as hell.\n It's just so you could just send a ship around chilling.\n Are you kidding?\n In the middle of crazy storms and then back up all the way and then it is too funny.\n Oh my God.\n So let me just take nightmare.\n So yeah, it'd be great to just have it not get on a boat.\n It crossed the Pacific and Atlantic and that kind of thing.\n So maybe similar to Vincent's question, what's the biggest advantage in choosing Berlin\n compared to other European countries?\n Berlin has the best nightclubs.\n That's true.\n How many bit?\n I went to Brooklyn once.\n Really?\n Yeah.\n Holy shit.\n That's cool.\n Yeah, it was a few years ago.\n Well, I don't know.\n I mean, he looked at a lot of different locations and I don't know.\n We could have put him in a lot of locations.\n We needed to move quickly and actually this place, it's like 30 minutes to the outskirts\n of Berlin, technically in Brandenburg.\n It actually was a place location that BMW was going to put a plant there.\n So a ton of the environmental work and all of the permits and stuff had already been\n done.\n And then for some reason, BMW chose a different location.\n But there's like, I guess, something on the order of a year's worth of environmental paperwork\n and stuff that's been done on that location for an auto plant.\n So that's one of the quickest places to get going.\n And generally, the government, local and state government was very supportive.\n So I went there and it's like, OK, this seems like some pretty good vibes this place.\n So this is a lovely part of this lovely place.\n And there's an opportunity for-- it's close enough to Berlin that say young people could\n still live in an apartment in Berlin and commute to the factory.\n It's right, there's a train station.\n They actually can move the train station.\n It's a small train station.\n But they're going to move the train station to where you can literally get off the train\n and be right at the gig of Berlin.\n Wow.\n That's great.\n That's great.\n It could literally just pop right off and walk very unadvisable.\n So then it's like, OK, this is pretty cool.\n And so young people could be in Berlin, apartment, and it's a little quirky here in Berlin.\n But if you want to have more of a family situation, the backyard is affordable, housing available\n with houses with yards and stuff that aren't too expensive.\n Yeah.\n So it seems like a good combination of factors.\n Yeah, a lot of talent in the area.\n So it sounds cool to Google

{"prompt": "Please improve this email \"The long-term larger vision is for application owners to be able to define their applications in EmpowerID and manage their authorization assignments and policies using either a coarse-grained (app rights and app roles) or fine-grained (app rights, app roles, field values aka “context”) model. Customers wish to avoid calling back to a central PDP due to latency and single point of failure so the architecture will support a distributed “offline” PDP model which, if the spike is successful, would be fulfilled by OPA. Distributed OPA instances would “pull” down just the JSON data needed for the applications they serve as PDP. The OPA PDP should offer a variety of authorization calls/endpoint methods such as: 1) asking for all specific UI resources for which the user has any access assignment in that app, 2) passing a username, application, optionally a resource, and a right and retrieving all context/constraints/field type values the user has for that right cross their assignments. 3) passing a username, application, right, optional resource, and constraint values and returning a true/false authorization decision. 4) passing a username, application, database table name, and returning the constraints to be used/injected as where clause filters in the apps data access layer. \n\nThese are just some of the scenarios we wish to support. For the initial spike, we want to use JSON data that is an approximation of the PBAC policy data in EmpowerID and create a rego file that we can test in a simple .NET app to validate this as a workable solution. After this is proven, we’ll move into the details of designing various best practice application templates or an SDK to leverage this new model and then the harder work of how we will support the data flow for this distributed OPA model where the data lives in a central SQL database but is shipped or pulled down to distributed OPA instances. \n\nCan you guys sync up and get rolling on the basics of our spike on Monday? I can join various calls if possible but I really want this to roll fast so we can present some preliminary results to Daimler by the end of the week. \"<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "I would like to brainstorm 10 equps that deal damage in interesting ways. We can use chance a lot. For example:\n\nDeal 10 damage\nDeal 1 damage 5 times\nDeal 5 damage, 50% chance of dealing another 5 damage until miss\nDeal 100 damage, gain 10 corruption\nDeal 30 damage, If this attack deals more than 50 damage, add 5 rage\n\n# GAME SUMMARY:\nThe RPG game is a rogue like where the player advances through multiple encounters, some of which are battles, and collects equips.\nBy equipping these equips to their characters, their characters get new abilities in battle, which allows them to win more difficult battles and advance further.\n\n# BATTLE MECHANICS SUMMARY:\nEach battle has two teams, the player and the enemy ai.\nThe player team consists of 3 characters, called Dimensionals\nThe enemy team consists of 1 or more characters, called Enemies\n\nEach team takes turns, where they cast equips to modify the battle state.\nThe battle state is modified by apply effects to characters and equips.\nUsually effect modifies statuses, which persist between turns.\n\nThere are two types of equips, active and passive.\nActive equips will immediately apply effects when cast.\nPassive equips are not cast, but instead listen to triggers in the battle and apply effects or modify other effects.\nEach character has equips that have been equipped to them by the player before the battle starts\n\nThe player starts their turn with a set amount of mana.\nEach active equip costs mana.\nAs the player casts active equips, it will deplete their mana\nOnce the players mana is less than their lowest available equip mana cost, the turn ends.\n\nThe player can only cast each active equips once per turns\nUnless the equip has the refresh status, or is modified to refresh and become active again\n\nEach character has the status maxHP, and the status HP\nWhen a characters HP reaches zero, they die and can no longer cast active or passive equips equiped to them.\n\n# LISP MOD STRUCTURE:\nThere is a set of lisp files that have been bound to the core C# game engine\nThese lisp files also define macros that simplify the modding script\nThese lisp files define all battle mechanics summarized above\nAll lisp code required to fully modify the game is contained in a single lisp file\nBoiler plate macros and functions are contained in a core.l lisp file\n\n# LISP CODING GUIDE\n\n## Statuses\nStatus are ints that are modified by effects\nStatus are keyed by equip or character, so each character and equip will have their own set of status variables\n\nHere is an example of setting a status \"'hp\" on a character:\n (hasStatus character 'hp)\n (statusGet character 'hp)\n (statusDecrement character 'hp amount)\n (statusIncrement character 'hp amount)\n (statusSet character 'hp amount)\n\nWe the wrap these functions in HP status functions for naming convineince as follows. This is not strictly necessary, but makes the code more readable:\n\n (defun isAlive (character)\n (hasStatus character 'hp))\n\n (defun isDead (character)\n (not (isAlive character)))\n\n (defun getHp (character)\n (statusGet character 'hp))\n\n (defun getHpMax (character)\n (statusGet character 'hpMax))\n\n (defun statusHpDecrement (character amount)\n (statusDecrement character 'hp amount))\n\n (defun statusHpIncrement (character amount)\n (statusIncrement character 'hp amount))\n\n (defun statusHpSet (character amount)\n (statusSet character 'hp amount))\n\nEvery status will have its own unique wrappers, depending on the functionality of the status.\n\n### Effects:\nEffects are objects that contain data and logic which are used to modify a status.\n\nFor example, the damage effect is used to modify the HP status of a character by subtracting the effectAmount damage.\n\nEffects are used by equips to modify battle state.\nActive equips will apply their effects when cast\nPassive equips will apply their effects on certain triggers\n\nEffects are defined in code like this:\n (defEffectExt damage (amount)\n (when (isAlive effectTarget)\n (statusHpDecrement effectTarget effectAmount)))\n\nEffects can be nested within other effects:\n (defEffectExt rageAbsorb ()\n (applyEffect (rage (getRage effectTarget)) effectEquip effectSource effectSource)\n (applyEffect (rageReset) effectEquip effectSource effectTarget))\n\nEffects can have conditional logic, based on statuses:\n (defEffectExt heatBlow (amount)\n (if (hasBlock effectTarget) (applyEffect (corruption amount) effectEquip effectSource effectTarget) (applyEffect (damage amount) effectEquip effectSource effectTarget)))\n\nEffects have various helper functions that can be used for custom logic:\n### Triggers:\nTriggers are event handlers that listen for specific events in the battle. They can contain any logic, but primarily are used to apply effects.\n\nTriggers are used frequently by passive equips and other game logic to react to a specific change in state.\n\nThere are three types of events triggers listen to. 'OnEvent', 'BeforeEvent' and 'AfterEvent'.\n\nThere are two types of Triggers:\n - instant trigger: will be executed before queued effects are applied\n - delayed trigger: will be executed after all queued effects have been applied. Most triggers are delayed.\n\nTriggers defined for passive equips take two additional arguments, equip and owner.\n\nHere are the list of available triggers. These are trigged by either commands or effects: \\*Setup\\*,\\*Start\\*,\\*EquipStartEffectGroupApply\\*,\\*BattleStart\\*,\\*CheckEnd\\*,\\*End\\*,\\*BattleWin\\*,\\*BattleLose\\*,\\*RoundBegin\\*,\\*RoundEnd\\*,\\*TeamTurnBegin\\*,\\*TeamForecast\\*,\\*Forecast\\*,\\*TeamForecastReplay\\*,\\*ForecastReplay\\*,\\*ForecastCancel\\*,\\*TeamTurnEnd\\*,\\*TeamManaRestore\\*,\\*TeamManaSpend\\*,\\*TurnBegin\\*,\\*TurnEnd\\*,\\*CharacterCreate\\*,\\*CharacterDie\\*,\\*StatusSet\\*,\\*StatusDecrement\\*,\\*StatusIncrement\\*,\\*EquipStatusSet\\*,\\*EquipStatusDecrement\\*,\\*EquipStatusIncrement\\*,\\*EquipsSync\\*,\\*EquipCreate\\*,\\*EquipTrigger\\*,\\*EquipDestroy\\*,\\*Cast\\*,\\*EffectGroupApply\\*,\\*EffectApply\\*\n\n#### Trigger Examples\nHere is an example of a passive equip that uses an instant trigger to prevent poison damage:\n (defPassive Antibody-3 3 \"icon:Card\\_PoisonBlade\" \"Antibody\" \"Character is unaffected by \" anyType\n (setTriggers\n (defInstantTriggerExt \\*beforePoisonDamage\\* 'Antibody-3 (equip owner effect)\n (when (and (isEffectIncoming effect owner) (isAlive owner))\n (setEffectAmount effect 0)\n (applyEffect (poisonDamageImmune) equip owner owner)))))\n\nHere is an example of a passive that adds block after damage has been applied:\n (defPassive Trapper1-Block-1 1 nil \"Block\" \"Adds 10 when damaged\" anyType\n (setTriggers\n (defTriggerExt \\*afterDamage\\* 'Trapper1-Block-1 (equip owner effect)\n (when (isEffectIncoming effect owner)\n (applyEffect (block 10) equip owner owner)))))\n\nHere is an example of a Passive Equip being defined, which uses a trigger to add block to all allies on turn begin:\n (defPassive Hard-Shell-1 1 \"icon:Card\\_DiversionCall\" \"Hard Shell\" \"Allies gain 5 at the start of the turn\" anyType\n (setTriggers\n (defTriggerExt \\*onTurnBegin\\* 'Hard-Shell-1 (equip owner character)\n (when (and (eql owner character) (isAlive owner))\n (applyEffectOnAllies (block 5) equip owner)))))\n\nWe define macros to make trigger code more concise, for example:\n (defmacro defTriggerOnCharacterDie (id &"}

{"prompt": "I'm creating a Gospel account of a sacred figure, called the Teacher, who emerges during the Covid era with a new gospel of curiosity and resilience. Below is a revised version of the Sermon on the Mount, rewritten according to his teachings. The Sermon is followed by a list of his teachings. Based on this information, list passages from the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Bhagavad Gita, the Tao te Ching, and Seneca that would be part of the Teacher's morning meditation:\n\nThe Teacher gathered his disciples on a hillside and began to teach them.\n\"Blessed are those who are curious,\" he said, \"for they shall seek knowledge and understanding.\"\n\"Blessed are those who are resilient,\" he continued, \"for they shall weather the storms of life and emerge stronger.\"\n\"You have heard it said, 'Love your neighbor as yourself,'\" the Teacher said. \"But I say to you, be curious about your neighbor. Ask questions, seek to understand their perspective. Learn from them, and share your own knowledge and understanding.\"\n\"And when someone disagrees with you,\" the Teacher said, \"do not be discouraged. Instead, be resilient. Use their disagreement as an opportunity to learn and grow. Seek out new ideas and perspectives, and be willing to change your mind if the evidence warrants it.\"\n\"You have heard it said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,'\" the Teacher said. \"But I say to you, be curious about your enemies. Seek to understand their perspective, and be willing to forgive them. Remember that everyone is on a journey, and that we all make mistakes.\"\n\"And when you are faced with adversity,\" the Teacher said, \"do not give up. Instead, be resilient. Draw on your inner strength and your faith in the universe, and know that you can overcome even the greatest challenges.\"\n\"You have heard it said, 'Do not worry about tomorrow,'\" the Teacher said. \"But I say to you, be curious about the future. Seek out knowledge and understanding, and prepare yourself for the challenges ahead. And when those challenges come, be resilient. Face them with courage and determination, and know that you will emerge stronger.\"\nAnd so the Teacher continued to teach his disciples, preaching a gospel of curiosity and resilience. He knew that the world was a complex and challenging place, but he also knew that the power of these qualities could overcome even the greatest challenges.\n\nBased on the Sermon on the Mount, here are some key teachings associated with the Teacher:\nCuriosity: The Teacher emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding, asking questions, and learning from others.\nResilience: The Teacher encourages followers to weather the storms of life, overcome challenges, and emerge stronger.\nEngaging with others: The Teacher promotes open-mindedness, understanding different perspectives, and learning from both neighbors and enemies.\nPersonal growth: The Teacher advises followers to use disagreement as an opportunity to learn and grow, as well as to be willing to change their mind when evidence warrants it.\nForgiveness: The Teacher teaches the importance of being understanding and forgiving towards others, recognizing that everyone is on a journey and makes mistakes.\nDrawing on inner strength: The Teacher highlights the need to rely on one's faith in the universe and inner strength when faced with adversity.\nPreparation and adaptability: The Teacher urges followers to be curious about the future, prepare themselves for challenges, and face them with courage and determination.<|end_of_turn|>"}

Etant en villégiature en Vendée à cette période, nous avons​\nréservé un vol au départ de Nantes puisqu'il s'agissait d'un vol direct Nantes/​\nBerlin.​\nLe mardi 12 juillet à 11h54, nous recevons un appel de notre agence de voyage​\nqui nous informe que le vol TOTO1234 3410 est annulé en raison d'un mouvement social.​\nElle nous indique que nous pouvons bénéficier d'un vol de remplacement le 14​\njuillet au départ de Paris-Orly, départ à 18h20 par le vol TOTO1234 3400 - cf justificatif 7).​\nAfin de rejoindre Paris, nous avons été contraints de réserver deux places en TGV​\nà destination de Paris, départ à 9h05, pour un coût total de 105 € (cf justificatifs 1​\net 2).​\nLe 14 juillet, en route pour Nantes afin de déposer mon père et ma fille à la gare,​\nnous constatons sur l'application TRANSAVIA que le vol de remplacement est​\négalement annulé.​\nA 6h30, difficile de joindre le service client de la compagnie TRANSAVIA qui​\nn'ouvrait qu'à 7h.​\n\n ​\n\nA 7h05, j'envoie un message via l'application WhatsApp à Transavia...auquel j'ai​\nreçu une réponse à 13h29 (cf justificatif 11).​\nA 7H24, je parviens à joindre par téléphone une hôtesse d'accueil qui confirme la​\nsuppression du vol mais nous indique ne pas pouvoir nous proposer de solution​\nde remplacement avant le 17 juillet! Elle nous informe cependant que le préjudice​\nsera pris en charge, à savoir l'hébergement d'attente et le différentiel du coût du​\ntransport de substitution...​\nLe train pour Paris ayant été réservé ainsi que l'hôtel à Berlin, le transfert​\naéroport-hôtel et certaines visites sur place, nous recherchons désespérément​\nd'autres moyens de relier Berlin au départ de Paris. Je ne voulais pas laisser mon​\npère et ma fille prendre le train sans avoir trouvé une solution de transport​\nsubsidiaire une fois qu'ils seraient arrivés à Paris.​\nArrivés en gare ferroviaire de Nantes, nous achetons deux billets restants dans le​\nTHALYS 12345 départ Paris gare du Nord à Cologne (Allemagne), départ prévu le​\nlendemain 15 juillet à 7h55, arrivée à 11h15 pour un coût de 370€ (185€ par​\npersonne - cf justificatif 4). La réservation a été effectuée en 1ère classe puisqu'il​\nne restait plus que ces billets. 11 a fallu également réserver un autre billet pour un​\ntrain reliant Cologne à Berlin Spandau départ à 11h48, arrivée à Berlin à 15h59,​\npour un coût total de 294€ (cf justificatif 5).​\nLe départ ayant été décalé d'une journée, nous avons également réservé un hôtel​\n(IBIS STYLES Paris Cadet Lafayette) à proximité de la gare du Nord pour la nuit du​\n14 au 15 juillet, ceci pour un coût de 152,76€ (cf justificatif 3).​\nA notre grande surprise, nous recevons un mail de la compagnie TRANSAVIA le 14​\njuillet à 10h18 nous indiquant que les passagers avaient été reportés sur le vol air​\nFrance du 15 juillet vol AF 1534 départ à 18h le 15 juillet.​\nL'hôtesse d'accueil nous avait pourtant clairement verbalisé le matin-même​\nqu'aucune solution de remplacement n'était prévue pour les passagers du vol​\nannulé. Comment laisser partir un grand-père de 78 ans et sa petite fille mineure​\nà Paris sans être assurés qu'ils pouvaient relier ensuite Berlin? Pour ces raisons,​\nnous avions donc entrepris toutes les démarches afin de trouver une alternative.​\nAyant déjà engagé des frais supplémentaires (train et hôtel), cette proposition​\nintervenait trop tardivement.​\nNous déplorons la l'absence d'anticipation et d'informations chez Transavia​\nsachant qu'un mouvement social est déclaré 48h à l'avance, la mésinformation et​\nla méconnaissance des dispositions prises suite à l'annulation du vol TOTO1234 3410.​\nSuite à un courriel adressé à la compagnie Transavia le 28/07/2022 (cf justificatif​\n11), un mail nous a été envoyé le 09/08/2022 nous informant que nous allions​\nrecevoir dans les 10 prochains jours un remboursement d'un montant de 302€​\ncorrespondant aux taxes du billet aller (cf justificatif 12). Dans un second mail​\nreçu le 11/08/2022, Transavia nous informe que conformément au réglement​\neuropéen et suite à l'annulation du vol TOTO1234 3410 au départ de Nantes le​\n14/07/2022, nous sommes éligibles à une indemnisation de 250€ par passager,​\nsoit un montant total de 500€ (cf justificatif 13).​\nAinsi, nous devrions bénéficier d'un remboursement total de 802€.​\nOr, Transavia ne tient pas compte :​\n- de la première annulation de vol qui nous a obligé à acheter une place dans le​\ntrain Nantes-Paris (puisque le vol de remplacement proposé décollait de Paris, et ​\nnon de Nantes), soit un coût supplémentaire de 105€ (cf justificatifs l et 2),​\n- de l'obligation de trouver un moyen de transport subsidiaire (l'hôtesse d'accueil​\nde Trans"}

{"prompt": "ORIGIN STORY\nOnce upon a time, in the real world there was a neglected child. They had been forgotten by society and forgotten by their parents, so they found solace in stories and fantasy tales. They escaped the misery of the world around them with these tales, which brought them hope and joy. Responsible for this imagination is an archive of books in their grandparents’ house, an encyclopaedic collection.\n\nOne day, the child read about a fantasy world called Shut-Eye Town. A garden made of sugar.\nThis is when something peculiar happened; Niello felt a spark inside themselves that seemed to come from nowhere, but was familiar somehow. It was then that Carbon Tracity was born into existence - manifested from the child’s own hopes and dreams for something more than what they were dealt with in life, but also a lost hope of those dreams never coming true.\n\nCarbon Tracity arrived in the Wondersqualor with memories of living in the real world - although these memories were not concrete details, but rather fragments tied to fiction and imagination such as fairy tales or fantasy written by authors from the real world. And not just literature — a images from television, media and video games\n\nIt was here that Carbon Tracity discovered this realm beyond reality's cracks: a place where lost cultures existed alongside misremembered entities, ephemeral epiphanies, failed ideas, even things as minute as the first draft to a play - all converging together to create an ever-growing cosmic universe full of inspiration and imagination.\n\nCarbon Tracy lived in the House of Carbonie - a surreal house that had been built with memories, broken memories from the real world, pieces of stories and narratives which were fermenting and crystallising into Carbon rocks or evaporating into strangely sweet smells. The House of Carbonie was both a studio space, where Carbon Tracity could design ways to return to the real world; and a hall of mirrors, where endless manifestations of Carbon Tracity danced and inhabited every reflective surface.\n\nHowever, these reflections did not satisfy for long, for deep within their soul lay an ancient spark that yearned for more. So they went out into the wondersqualor on grand adventures to explore its depths - \nnever understanding its mysteries.\nAnd in the process of moving through the wondersqualor, Carbon Tracity developed the art of magitrace - a magical arts movement practice consisting of metaphysical metaphorical combinations that could expand and effect the wondersqualor. Carbon Tracity then used magitrace to weave ripples between all realms - both real and unreal - thereby combining them together in harmony. By doing so,they would be able to create a bridge between himself and the real world so that they could exist in perfect balance.\nTHE HOUSE OF CARBAGE\n\nThe House of Carbage is an ever-evolving amalgamation of the real world and the wondersqualor, a realm of forgotten entities and objects that have been misplaced from reality. It is part ancient tomb and an archive of the past, but is also an archive of the future, which means there are strange technological devices and machines, ideas for devices that aren’t fully formed and implemented, and have mysterious uses \n\nThe House of Carbage is not in one place. It is a house of garbage, which means that it has been thrown away many times, and so many instances of the house appear during the wondersqualor. To a degree, anything that is thrown away can become a House of Carbage. It frequently experiences something called The Night of Constructive Destruction, where ideas go wild and destroy the house and fill it with chaos.\n\nThe House of Carbage is like a hall of mirrors, inhabited by every manifestation of Carbon Tracy who dance amongst reflective surfaces and broken TV screens oozing with pixels. The walls are adorned with strange curiosities, spilled bottles full of memories, shelves filled with books whose pages are written in invisible ink, and forgotten artifacts flickering in and out of existence as if they were never there to begin with.Robot witch hats, something called monochromatic matter which is grey pixelated gray ooze.\nIt is full of the the remains of fairy tales, some kind of fairy tale rodent pests that are the remains of fairy tales.\nBut beneath the bedsheets lies more than just lost trinkets; it is here that one can find what lies at the heart of this place: Magitrace. This magical arts practice is peculiarly unique to the House—a ritualistic dance employed by Carbon Tracy to stir up the metaphysical metaphorical combination of imagination which exists within their home. Through this ritual, energy flows through objects located in both realms—the real world and wondersqualor alike—powering them up and allowing for modifications that could have ripple effects into either realm.\n\n\n(an example of this is a mysterious games console called The Carbon Consoling Soulcon which is a kind of life support games device that holds Carbon Tracy’s dreams, and devices that run on air projections).\n\nMAGITRACE\n\nMagitrace is a surreal, fantastical dance practice that brings together the real and imaginary worlds. It's a way to connect our dreams and hopes with reality, to create something tangible from our imagination. The dance itself is wild and unstructured; it's about freeing yourself of any expectations or limitations, allowing yourself to express whatever emotions you feel in the moment.\n\nAt its core, Magitrace is about exploring the boundaries between dreams and reality, between what we can see and what we imagine. If dreams and fantasy worlds can’t be reached physically in the real world, they can at least move our bodies, and bridge the gap. To do this, Carbon Tracy invites us to take a leap into the unknown. We start by imagining the dream we want to manifest: a fairytale princess dancing with her prince, for example. Once we have that image firmly in our minds, we then have to shatter it - breaking it into fragments of possibility and potential. These fragments are then woven together through wild movements of the body as Carbon Tracy moves in an almost chaotic manner - combining seemingly disparate pieces into something beautiful.\n\nThe beauty of Magitrace lies in its unpredictability - each performance is unique because no two imaginations are alike, no two shards will be exactly alike when broken apart. This makes it impossible for anyone else to replicate your own specific version of Magitrace; your own rendition of this strange dance will always be unique..\nTHE CARBONBON FLIES\n\nTHE FAIRY HEADS\n\nTHE FAIRY HEADS\n\nSo there is this worldbuilding project I am working on called the Wondersqualor, a fantasy, metaphysical, alternate dimension where ideas go to die and be reborn in weird, magical, bizarre, forms. In the wondersqualor there are entities called Fairy Heads, which are a kind of organic technology, mechanical lifeform that look like floating marionette heads. They are a play on ‘Fairy Tales,’ in that they are like, a 4d encapsulation of what a story is. While a Fairy Tale is linear, and happens ‘once upon a time’ a Fairy Head contains infinite manifestations of a story that span time and space, these stories are of course riffs on familiar folk stories and fairy tales. For instance, The Fairy Head called ‘Little Red Riding Hood’ is made up of every possible branching path of the story.\n\nWhen I encounter a Fairy Head, it might function like a normal computer, and it can be used like an operating system, and have a virtual interface. Or I could enter inside it, as if it were a digital, cyberspace realm.\n\nI\nAll Fairy Heads begin with ‘Once Upon a Space.’ A fairy head is the most complicated device. They are the most complex form of a Carbon Rock. They are, at its simplest level, natural machines that allow people access into a kind of cyberspace. The fairy head is a cross between a giant ancient organic robot head supercomputer, and a space mothership, and a generator of portals. . It is summoned from the mind by using memories, fantasies, fairy tales, and work holistically and systemically to propel the user to a place called 'once upon a time.' The technology is dream technology, which relies on chemistry and interactions of story elements to power it.\n\nThe fairy head is made of a unique metal exclusive to the wondersqualor, the element of trash. They are powered by a combination of carbon rocks (their insides looks like some kind of futuristic mineral cave, and something called white dwarfs\n\nThe inhabitants of the fairy head use their imagination to steer"}

{"prompt": "Hi, I want to explore the possibility of learning languages by memorizing first corpus of facts, and things about myself so that I can use it in conversation, and have that become some sort of vocabulary magnets. Whenever I meet someone new, and I mention that I speak Mandarin I'm old almost always talking about the same topics, which is self introduction, common interest, beliefs, opinions, and things like that so my idea is to compile all of these facts about myself and memorize all the Mandarin. Vocabulary for that and use that as a starting point to fluency.\n\n I am not starting from scratch. I already have a good understanding of the fundamentals of Mandarin, but I lack vocabulary and fluency when it comes to speaking so my idea is to build this foundation and of vocabulary and general topics to talk about, learned very well, and use it in conversations, and as the as time passes, and the conversation passes, I will organically start getting more practice, producing the languageAnd acquiring vocabulary\n\n what we're gonna do now is that we're gonna start a conversation in my target language, which is Mandarin Chinese. In order for us to keep the feedback going in my input and production of the language, I don't want to have to stop if I don't know a word or expression in Chinese. Therefore, I will put things I don't know in my response as parenthesize within my response, for example\n\n我最喜歡的甜食就是 (strawberry milkshake), 可是。我(nowadays)不喝了，因為（it is very fattening).\n\nIn the example above, the fragments in english are things that I don't know, and that I would like to know. Your response is divided in two parts:\n\nFeedback:[a corrected, mandarin only version of my input. this should populate any missing vocabulary or expressions AND ALSO potentially, but not necessarily, modify or rewrite the structure of my input for it to be more idiomatic, precise, correct, etc.\n\nResponse:[your actual response about the conversation we're having]\n\nWhen I respond, I will retype your feedback starting with > so I can memorize it. This is just me practicing, and should not be taken into consideration for correction or as conversational input. This is just me retyping your corrected statements so I can memorize them.\n\nWe have not started this exercise yet. i'd like to clarify your understanding before we continue.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Overview\n========================\n\n\\_A sandbox to test units against each other\\_\n\nThis scene is for testing the design of RTS units. Units can be assembled from prefabs of parts. Components for sensors and behaviours can be added. Part categories include weapons (such as lasers and missiles) and movement systems (like wheels, treads, or propellers).\n\nGame designers will create unit designs from the parts and components, and then place armies of these units in the scene. Units assigned to different teams will fight each other. The game designers will use this to test out new ideas for unit parts and to balance the units.\n\nEventually we'd like to release a game that combines the factory automation and RTS genres and allows players to assemble custom unit designs from parts, using conveyor belts and assemblers.\n\nFile descriptions\n========================\n\n## Behaviours\n\\* UnitBehaviour.cs - Base class for behaviours. Units can have multiple behaviours. Behaviours can be ordered in the editor and they will run in this order. Later behaviours can override actions from earlier behaviours.\n\\* SeekAndDestroy.cs - This behaviour causes a unit to patrol the area for enemies and attack any enemies found on sight.\n\\* Flee.cs - Makes the unit flee from battle. You can set it to only flee when low on health.\n\n## Parts\n\\* UnitPart.cs - Base class for parts. Currently has `weight` and provides a reference to the Unit for convenience. Will probably handle sockets as well.\n\\* Armor.cs - you can add this component to any part or unit. It will give the unit more hit points.\n\\* BasicGun.cs - A gun component. Add as part of a gun prefab to make it shoot. You can set properties of the gun such as the damage, cooldown and range.\n\\* BasicMovement.cs - A movement component. Parts with this component allow the unit to move. You can set properties such as the acceleration, top speed, turning radius, etc.\n\n## Sensors\n\\* Vision.cs - A component that lets the unit detect other units. It sees in a cone in front of the unit.\n\n## Designs\n\\* Peewee - A basic infantry unit with a gun.\n\\* Turret - A stationary, defensive unit with two cannons.\n\n## Other files\n\\* UnitManager.cs\n\\* Unit.cs\n\\* HealthBar.cs\n\n## Interfaces\n\\* IPosition - Anything that has a position. It contains a `Vector3 Position { get; }` property.\n\\* ITargetable - An interface for things that can be targeted, such as units, buildings, or even locations on the map.\n\\* IWeapon - An interface for weapons, such as BasicGun. You can call `SetTarget(ITargetable target)` to set a target for the weapon. The weapon should keep attacking that target automatically until it can't anymore or a new target is set.\n\\* IMovement - An interface for movement components, such as BasicMovement. You an call `SetTarget(ITargetable target, float proximity = 0.5f)` to tell it where to move to. The movement component should automatically move to within `proximity` meters of the target. If the target is a unit, it should follow the unit.\n\\* ISensor - For components that detects units.\n\\* IHealth - Something that has hit points, like a unit or building.\nPossible future features\n========================\n(A lot of these were suggested by ChatGPT)\n\n## Behaviours\n\\* DefendArea.cs: A behavior that makes the unit defend a specific area, engaging enemies that come too close.\n\\* RepairAndSupport.cs: A behavior that enables the unit to repair or support friendly units within a defined radius.\n\n## Parts\n\\* Shield.cs: A component that provides a regenerating energy shield to the unit, which can absorb a certain amount of damage before the armor or hit points are affected.\n\\* StealthSystem.cs: A part that allows the unit to become invisible or difficult to detect by enemy sensors.\n\\* ArtilleryWeapon.cs: A long-range weapon component with customizable attributes, such as projectile type, range, and splash damage.\n\n## Sensors\n\\* Radar.cs: A component that can detect cloaked units.\n\n## Designs\n\\* Scout: A fast-moving unit with enhanced sensors for reconnaissance and intel gathering.\n\\* Engineer: A support unit that can repair, build, or upgrade other units and structures.\n\\* HeavyAssault: A heavily armored unit with multiple weapon systems for dealing with various types of enemy units.\n\n## Utility classes\n\\* FormationManager.cs: A system for managing unit formations, allowing the player to create and modify formations for better control of their units.\n\\* DynamicObstacles.cs: A script that enables the creation of dynamic obstacles, such as destructible terrain or moving hazards, to add complexity and challenge to the sandbox.\n\n## UI\n\\* UnitSelectionUI.cs: A user interface for selecting and controlling individual units or groups of units.\n\\* UnitInfoPanel.cs: A panel that displays detailed information about a selected unit, including its current parts, sensors, and behaviors.\n\\* DesignBlueprintUI.cs: A user interface that allows the player to create, save, and load custom unit designs using available parts, sensors, and behaviors.\n\nPublic classes, properties and methods\n==============\n``` \npublic interface IPosition\n{\n Vector3 Position { get; }\n}\n\npublic interface ITargetable : IPosition\n{\n float Radius { get; }\n bool IsAlive { get; }\n void DealDamage(int damage) { }\n}\n\npublic enum MovementType { Ground, Flying }\n\npublic interface IMovement\n{\n // These stats are public mainly for displaying in the UI.

{"prompt": "can you write a detailed short story outline for this: A story about a crime and community service future society where you’re given a quick ai assessment of your skills after a brief interview and body scan. For smaller infringements there’s a lot more focus in the society on community service than there is on fines, after all fines really only affect rich folk. There are different tiers to community service though based on how important the work is and how few people there are to do it. You can pick what you want to do. Some people don’t have a lot of skills or they do and they pick something easy and end up doing a bunch of manual labor. Others do data entry. The work that pays the best is those mime work. Not everyone is suited for it. Looks and activity and age all matter. But for those that fit the skill well, few things pay better. Lots of eligible people would rather sign up for an afternoon of work rather than suffer through a week picking up trash at the side of the road. Not everyone is suited for it and mime work can be emotionally and physically exhaustive. you can always tap out. Everyone makes sure you can get out but if you do, you get zero credit. So this story is about two friends who were in trouble for using ai for plagiarism in one of their college courses. They signed up together and when they were looking through the jobs on their personal devices they both laughed at first. How hilarious is it that they both scored so high on the mime service. Neither of them had been a mime. Well not professionally. They’d both done mime stuff just for fun. Little bit here and there and never in public. The idea seemed so humiliating and they talk about it a bit. One girl had a friend who did it and they assigned her in an other town and no one knew until she started telling people herself. She was proud, apparently that she got the rumors going herself, or at least that’s what she said. so the two friends were looking at the different options for being a mime. They could mime privately once for a single person over the course of an entire week. They could do hand miming for patients at the hospital and senior center. But that was for three shifts of four hours. There were so many options. They could even spend one six hour shift miming at a women’s only mime club. They considered that even though neither of them had performed for women and weren’t interested in trying it. But the two friends were fans of the easy way out and there was an opening at the central square in Waterford, about thirty minutes away. It was government run place for mimes. They’d seen it and even known some seniors at their high school who said they went there all the time and it was expensive but worth it. But this gig was different. They would be performing in the kiosk. It was almost like an atm booth. Lots and lots of turnover. They had all seen it. It was a separate door and there was usually short line outside but the people came and went so the line never got too long. It was mostly men on their way home who wanted to see a quick mime show. it was into the kiosk and back out. So if the two friends each signed up for that it was only two hours of service each. They weren’t sure how long it would take for each person to see them mime. One of the friends assumed it would probably be four or five per hours because people must take a bit before they were done watching. so the girls sign up. The day of thought they are told something a little scary. Everyone in line watches. Some people like watching others watch a mime show. One of the friends brothers knew how it worked and they admitted going to a few times. Everyone only had five minutes to watch but that’s usually all they ever needed because there was a special mime makeup they could apply to themselves before stepping up for their turn to see the show themselves. When wearing that themselves it always went faster. the friend had to call to arrange a time when they could go together but they found out they would be at two different stations in the same “gallery” as it was called. the day of they arrived a little late so they missed half of the orientation but said it was fine. One of them covered for the other, saying they had been there before and knew the drill. That wasn’t a great idea. They were brought to their mime stations and locked into place. It was punitive miming so they weren’t shocked they had to mime in a stockade but they did anyway. The bulk of the story is a description of each of the men (and a couple women actually) who visited. It’s important to always look your best when being a mime so there was a hose and a pump dispenser with makeup there. It was a strange makeup though and both of the women found that it tingled a bit but the makeup from the dispenser actually felt nice. Which was good because the perfances themselves were exhausting and they never stopped comming. The bulk of the story is made of details of the individual encounters. Then at the end they were removed, exhausted from the stockage and placed in an after show lounge where they decompressed for a bit and shared stories. They ended up performing for each other because they were worked up from performing as a mime for everyone else. Then the story ends.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Here is an article by David sacks. I want you to look through this article and create a prompt that would allow you to understand the content of the article and for people to ask questions of it\n\nAlmost 20 years ago, a startup named Jigsaw pioneered a new crowdsourcing model where users would contribute data to a platform in exchange for access to its services. Jigsaw is largely forgotten today, but its so-called “give-to-get” model could be perfect for AI startups that need to obtain rich proprietary datasets to train their models. These datasets are crucial to improve accuracy and performance of AI models, to provide a competitive advantage over rivals, to allow customization and specialization for industry-specific needs, and to reduce reliance on third-party data sources. This post will discuss the Jigsaw model, its applicability to AI, the challenges in obtaining proprietary training datasets, and the industry verticals where it could be applied.\n\nJigsaw and the Give-to-Get Model\n\nJigsaw Data Corporation was founded in 2004 by Jim Fowler and Garth Moulton. The company’s primary product was a large, crowdsourced, searchable database containing millions of business contacts across various industries. In the days before everyone had a LinkedIn profile, this was particularly valuable to sales people looking for prospects.\n\nJigsaw’s crowdsourcing model revolved around a points system. Users could create a free account on Jigsaw’s platform by contributing their own business contact information. They could also add new contacts to the database to earn points, which they could then spend to see contacts posted by others. Users who didn’t want to contribute their own data could purchase points. Jigsaw also encouraged users to verify the accuracy of contact information in the database by rewarding them with points for each correction made.\nIn 2010, Salesforce.com acquired Jigsaw for $142 million, rebranded it as “Data.com” and integrated it with the Salesforce.com ecosystem. This allowed users to access updated business contact information within their CRM system directly.\n\nThe Give-to-Get Model for AI\n\nThe give-to-get model, where users earn points by contributing data and spend points to access services based on that data, could be an effective approach for AI startups. In many industry verticals, obtaining a rich proprietary dataset will be the key challenge to producing a differentiated AI model. By incentivizing professionals in that industry to share the necessary data, AI startups can rapidly train and improve their models to serve those professionals.\n\nFor example, an “AI architect” startup could give users points for contributing architectural plans and CAD drawings. Users could then spend points by asking the AI to design new plans. This approach could be used across a variety of industries where users have proprietary data and would be willing to contribute some of it in exchange for harnessing AI capabilities.\n\nIncentivizing users to crowdsource could be a cost-effective way to acquire large amounts of data, as it leverages the efforts of a community rather than relying on paid data collection services. As users contribute more data and use the AI’s services, the model can be iteratively improved, leading to better performance and more valuable insights.\n\nThere will be some important issues to work out. Ensuring the quality and accuracy of the contributed data is critical. Startups may need to implement verification processes, such as peer review or expert validation, to maintain data quality. Handling proprietary data also comes with privacy and intellectual property concerns that will need to be addressed. Startups may need to ensure that certain data will be used for training purposes only and be transparent in how the contributed data is used. Compliance with industry-specific regulations is also crucial.\n\nFinally, the need to monetize must be balanced against the points-based system; otherwise users may prefer to use the platform for free forever by contributing data rather than paying for services. Points could be limited so that users earn a discount or are awarded more queries as opposed to receiving the service completely for free.\n\nOpportunities in Diverse Industries\n\nA give-to-get, crowdsourced data collection approach could be applied to a number of industry verticals where the target users are in possession of the training data. Here are some examples of where this approach could be useful:\n\nMedical and health data: AI models can greatly benefit from access to diverse patient data, such as electronic health records, medical imaging, and genomic data. Users (patients or healthcare professionals) might be willing to share anonymized data in exchange for points, which could then be used to access AI-driven health insights, personalized treatment suggestions, or early disease detection.\n\nLegal document analysis: Law firms and legal professionals often have access to large collections of legal documents, such as contracts, court rulings, or patent filings. By sharing these documents, users could contribute to training AI models for legal document analysis, and in return, gain access to AI-driven legal research tools or contract review services.\n\nArt and creative work: Artists and designers may possess large collections of their own artwork, sketches, or designs. Sharing this data could help train AI models for artistic style transfer, generative art, or design assistance. Users could then access AI-driven creative tools or personalized design suggestions.\n\nFinance and investment: Financial professionals and investors may have access to proprietary trading algorithms, portfolio data, or market analysis reports. By sharing this data, they could contribute to AI models for financial analysis and predictions. In return, users could gain access to AI-driven investment advice, risk assessment, or market forecasting tools.\n\nScientific research data: Researchers in various fields might have access to valuable datasets generated through experiments or simulations. By sharing this data, they can help train AI models for data analysis, pattern recognition, or predictive modeling in their respective domains. Users could then access AI-driven research tools or personalized research recommendations.\n\nManufacturing and production data: Companies involved in manufacturing and production may possess proprietary data on production processes, quality control, and equipment performance. Sharing this data could improve AI models for predictive maintenance, process optimization, and quality assurance. Users could then gain access to AI-driven optimization suggestions or equipment monitoring services.\nConclusion\n\nObtaining rich proprietary training datasets will be the key challenge for startups looking to create AI models for industry verticals. Crowdsourcing this data from the professionals who work in these industries may be an excellent approach to solve this problem. Moreover, crowdsourcing should create a flywheel: as users contribute data to the model, the model gets smarter and more capable, which draws in the next set of users, who provide the next set of data. This data network effect should create a strong moat around the business. That said, potential risks or downsides related to the give-to-get model, such as data quality, privacy, and intellectual property concerns, must be addressed proactively by startups in order to ensure the long-term success of their AI models.\n\nI used ChatGPT-4 to help me write this blog post.

{"prompt": "Consider the following adaptation setting-one-shot, for most of this problem. There are two parties, $A$ and $B$. There is a state of the world $s$ that takes two values $s\\_1$ and $s\\_2$ with probabilities $p$ and $1-p$ respectively.

As in the adaptation model we discussed in class, in any given state, there are only two decisions of interest, but here we modify the payoffs slightly, as follows.\nWe write $u\\_A(d, s)$ and $u\\_B(d, s)$ to denote the payoffs to $A$ and $B$ in state $s$ when decision $d$ is taken. We write $i, j$, or $k$ for the parties $(A$ or $B)$ and $m$ or $n$ for the states $\\left(s\\_1\\right.$ or $\\left.s\\_2\\right)$. The following formal statements capture the idea that, in a given state, each party has a preferred decision but also would get a positive payoff from the other party's preferred decision, whereas both parties will get zero if either of their preferred decisions in the other state is taken.\n- In state $m$, decisions $d\\_{A n}$ and $d\\_{B n}$ yield 0 for both players:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& u\\_A\\left(d\\_{A 2}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_A\\left(d\\_{B 2}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_A\\left(d\\_{A 1}, s\\_2\\right)=u\\_A\\left(d\\_{B 1}, s\\_2\\right)=0 \\\\\n& u\\_B\\left(d\\_{A 2}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{B 2}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{A 1}, s\\_2\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{B 1}, s\\_2\\right)=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n- In state $m, A$ 's preferred decision $d\\_{A m}$ yields some $K>0$ for player $B$, and similarly, $B$ 's preferred decision $d\\_{B m}$ yields $K$ for player $A$ :\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& u\\_A\\left(d\\_{B 1}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{A 1}, s\\_1\\right)=K \\\\\n& u\\_A\\left(d\\_{B 2}, s\\_2\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{A 2}, s\\_2\\right)=K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n- In state $m, A$ 's preferred decision $d\\_{A m}$ yields some $U\\_{A m}^\\*>0$ for $A$.

{"prompt": "You are a very good copy editor. Please take the following and improve its organisation, phrasing and grammar.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nNoam Chomsky argues in an article in the New York Times 8-March-2023 \"The False Promise of ChatGPT\" that AI cannot think. \n\nNoam Chomsky says of the current examples of Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence such as ChatGPT that they do not think. His\nconclusion might be wrong, it might be right, but his reasoning is\nfaulty.\n\nEssentially Chomsky argues using circular reasoning what humans do\nis thinking, and what machines do is not. His justification gives\nexceptionalism a bad name! He arrogantly defines all that humans do\nas thinking and he denies that machines can think because they are\nmachines. That is what he says in his article again and again. And he\nstates this prejudice as his conclusion, as if he got there by reasoning.\n\nHis article is long, too long, and almost paragraph by paragraph one\ncan argue with him. Let me tackle only this example of his:\n\n Here’s an example. Suppose you are holding an apple in your\n hand. Now you let the apple go. You observe the result and say,\n “The apple falls.” That is a description. A prediction\n might have been the statement “The apple will fall if I open\n my hand.” Both are valuable, and both can be correct. But an\n explanation is something more: It includes not only descriptions\n and predictions but also counterfactual conjectures like “Any\n such object would fall,” plus the additional clause “because\n of the force of gravity” or “because of the curvature of\n space-time” or whatever. That is a causal explanation: “The\n apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.”\n That is thinking.\n\nYes, that is thinking. Chomsky thinks here he is telling us what only\nhumans do. Task by task\nhe describes a human ability and then he says, \"That is thinking.\"\nWhat he does not do in this paragraph is recognise that ChatGPT can do\nall of these tasks also. If Chomsky concludes \"that is thinking\" then\nthat must be evidence of thinking for anything which can do those tasks.\nAccording to Chomsky's own argument ChatGPT can think.\n\nWhat all (but a tiny handful of humans) are doing when they say “The\napple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity” is precisely\nwhat ChatGPT is doing when it too says the same, and it does say the\nsame. Both humans and ChatGPT are merely merely reciting what they\nwere taught, their \"training\ndata\". Neither 99%-of-humans nor ChatGPT understand what is going on.\n\nNewton and Einstein and Feynman and their like may have a deeper understanding\nbut other humans merely recite what they were told. Apples fall because\nof gravity. And ChatGPT knows this in the same way as humans, it's\nin the training data of humans and AI. Humans do not work this out,\nthey recite a fact. So does ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT also does all the rest Chomsky claims as uniquely human\ncapabilities in his example. ChatGPT can do the description of the\napple falling and the prediction that it will fall. It can do what Chomsky\nunnecessarily uses technical language for, it can do the \"counterfactual\nconjecture\", it knows that all objects fall! ChatGPT knows this is\n“because of the curvature of space-time”. ChatGPT knows this\n\"causal explanation\" better than most humans. ChatGPT knows “The\napple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.” Yes,\nand here I agree with Noam Chomsky: He says of the \"causal\nexplanation\" that \"That is thinking.\"\n\nIf ChatGPT is not thinking when it says all that then neither are humans\nUNLESS thinking is defined as something that humans do and ChatGPT\ndoes not. The only way Chomsky can support his assertion is by defining\n\"thinking\" and \"knowing\" and \"description\" and \"prediction\" and \"generalising\"\netc etc as being that which are uniquely human capabilities. Chomsky's argument\ndepends upon the circularity where he takes as an unstated but necessary\npredicate that only humans can think. He concludes, after many paragraphs\nof delusional obfuscation that thinking is what only humans can do.\n\nNow, Chomsky is a great man and he may be right. But he doesn't show\nthis in his article.\n\n\\_\\_\\_<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "I'm writing an article about some bad experiences engineers had with codebases at previous workplaces. I wrote multiple short stories from a Reddit thread.\n\nHere's one example:\n\nReddit user zoozla shared a story about working on a massive Java monolith that was part of the foreign exchange system used by banks to trade currency. The codebase featured a dizzying 8 layers of abstract classes with just one concrete class at the bottom. It also contained an almost Turing-complete language in XML for parsing legacy binary files. To make matters worse, running the unit tests modified the dev database, requiring manual reseeding after each run. Zoozla spent months attempting to refactor the worst parts of the code, but with little success.\n\nHere is another example:\n\nShnorkylutyun experienced the nightmares of nested generics and wrappers around every possible base type in a Java app. There were mappings between the wrappers and different types of wrappers, along with generic classes describing generic forms with 10+ fields, each with separate generics for every field's type. Form wizards with up to 6 generic types per page only added to the chaos. Rearranging the order of two fields in a form was a cause for celebration if both were Strings.\n\nI'd like to add an intro to each story describing the (faulty) process that lead to the awful state the code is at. I'd like to show the original developers had the best of intentions, but lacked foresight, or knowledge, just cruft accumulated over the years.\n\nHere's an possible intro for the first example:\n\n\"There is no problem that can't be solved by adding another layer of abstraction\" goes the adage. Indeed it is hard to resist the urge to organize code into neat abstraction levels that make for great high level diagrams and offer a clear API. Well that's the theory at least. In practice, all abstractions tend to leak heavily, tend to pile up - abstracting away the important bits of code you're actually looking for, and turn simple debugging an arduous journey of navigating the memory palace of novel classes and objects.\n\nWrite an intro to the second example.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Overview\n========================\n\n\\_A sandbox to test units against each other\\_\n\nThis scene is for testing the design of RTS units. Units can be assembled from prefabs of parts. Components for sensors and behaviours can be added. Part categories include weapons (such as lasers and missiles) and movement systems (like wheels, treads, or propellers).\n\nGame designers will create unit designs from the parts and components, and then place armies of these units in the scene. Units assigned to different teams will fight each other. The game designers will use this to test out new ideas for unit parts and to balance the units.\n\nEventually we'd like to release a game that combines the factory automation and RTS genres and allows players to assemble custom unit designs from parts, using conveyor belts and assemblers.\n\nFile descriptions\n========================\n\n## Behaviours\n\\* UnitBehaviour.cs - Base class for behaviours. Units can have multiple behaviours. Behaviours can be ordered in the editor and they will run in this order. Later behaviours can override actions from earlier behaviours.\n\\* SeekAndDestroy.cs - This behaviour causes a unit to patrol the area for enemies and attack any enemies found on sight.\n\\* Flee.cs - Makes the unit flee from battle. You can set it to only flee when low on health.\n\n## Parts\n\\* UnitPart.cs - Base class for parts. Currently has `weight` and provides a reference to the Unit for convenience. Will probably handle sockets as well.\n\\* Armor.cs - you can add this component to any part or unit. It will give the unit more hit points.\n\\* BasicGun.cs - A gun component. Add as part of a gun prefab to make it shoot. You can set properties of the gun such as the damage, cooldown and range.\n\\* BasicMovement.cs - A movement component. Parts with this component allow the unit to move. You can set properties such as the acceleration, top speed, turning radius, etc.\n\n## Sensors\n\\* Vision.cs - A component that lets the unit detect other units. It sees in a cone in front of the unit.\n\n## Designs\n\\* Peewee - A basic infantry unit with a gun.\n\\* Turret - A stationary, defensive unit with two cannons.\n\n## Other files\n\\* UnitManager.cs\n\\* Unit.cs\n\\* HealthBar.cs\n\n## Interfaces\n\\* IPosition - Anything that has a position. It contains a `Vector3 Position { get; }` property.\n\\* ITargetable - An interface for things that can be targeted, such as units, buildings, or even locations on the map.\n\\* IWeapon - An interface for weapons, such as BasicGun. You can call `SetTarget(ITargetable target)` to set a target for the weapon. The weapon should keep attacking that target automatically until it can't anymore or a new target is set.\n\\* IMovement - An interface for movement components, such as BasicMovement. You an call `SetTarget(ITargetable target, float proximity = 0.5f)` to tell it where to move to. The movement component should automatically move to within `proximity` meters of the target. If the target is a unit, it should follow the unit.\n\\* ISensor - For components that detects units.\n\\* IHealth - Something that has hit points, like a unit or building.\nPossible future features\n========================\n(A lot of these were suggested by ChatGPT)\n\n## Behaviours\n\\* DefendArea.cs: A behavior that makes the unit defend a specific area, engaging enemies that come too close.\n\\* RepairAndSupport.cs: A behavior that enables the unit to repair or support friendly units within a defined radius.\n\n## Parts\n\\* Shield.cs: A component that provides a regenerating energy shield to the unit, which can absorb a certain amount of damage before the armor or hit points are affected.\n\\* StealthSystem.cs: A part that allows the unit to become invisible or difficult to detect by enemy sensors.\n\\* ArtilleryWeapon.cs: A long-range weapon component with customizable attributes, such as projectile type, range, and splash damage.\n\n## Sensors\n\\* Radar.cs: A component that can detect cloaked units.\n\n## Designs\n\\* Scout: A fast-moving unit with enhanced sensors for reconnaissance and intel gathering.\n\\* Engineer: A support unit that can repair, build, or upgrade other units and structures.\n\\* HeavyAssault: A heavily armored unit with multiple weapon systems for dealing with various types of enemy units.\n\n## Utility classes\n\\* FormationManager.cs: A system for managing unit formations, allowing the player to create and modify formations for better control of their units.\n\\* DynamicObstacles.cs: A script that enables the creation of dynamic obstacles, such as destructible terrain or moving hazards, to add complexity and challenge to the sandbox.\n\n## UI\n\\* UnitSelectionUI.cs: A user interface for selecting and controlling individual units or groups of units.\n\\* UnitInfoPanel.cs: A panel that displays detailed information about a selected unit, including its current parts, sensors, and behaviors.\n\\* DesignBlueprintUI.cs: A user interface that allows the player to create, save, and load custom unit designs using available parts, sensors, and behaviors.\n\nPublic classes, properties and methods\n==============\n``` \npublic interface IPosition\n{\n Vector3 Position { get; }\n}\n\npublic interface ITargetable : IPosition\n{\n float Radius { get; }\n bool IsAlive { get; }\n void DealDamage(int damage) { }\n}\n\npublic enum MovementType { Ground, Flying }\n\npublic interface IMovement\n{\n // These stats are public mainly for displaying in the UI.

I am gonna feed you some information about it. okey?\n2.\nThis is how Midjourney work:\nMidjourney is another AI-powered tool that generates images from user prompts. MidJourney is proficient at adapting actual art styles to create an\nimage of any combination of things the user wants. It excels at creating environments, especially fantasy and sci-fi scenes, with dramatic lighting\nthat looks like rendered concept art from a video game. How does Midjourney work?\nMidjourney is an AI image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm\ntrained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images. is powered by Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image\nsynthesis technique. Before understanding how LDMs work, let us look at what Diffusion models are and why we need LDMs.\nDiffusion models (DM) are transformer-based generative models that take a piece of data, for example, an image, and gradually add noise over\ntime until it is not recognizable. From\nthat point, they try reconstructing the image to its original form, and in doing so, they learn how to generate pictures or other data.\nThe issue with DMs is that the powerful ones often consume hundreds of GPU days, and inference is quite expensive due to sequential\nevaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources without compromising their quality as well as flexibility, DMs are applied in\nthe latent space of powerful pre-trained autoencoders.\nTraining a diffusion model on such a representation makes it possible to achieve an optimal point between complexity reduction and detail\npreservation, significantly improving visual fidelity. Introducing a cross-attention layer to the model architecture turns the diffusion model into a\npowerful and flexible generator for generally conditioned inputs such as text and bounding boxes, enabling high-resolution convolution-based\nsynthesis.\nBut wait, I have more info.

This comprehensive guide provides an in-depth overview of CMS and DAM products, their use-cases, detailed consumer profiles, scalability, and the evolving needs of companies. We will also discuss the role of consulting firms in helping businesses optimize these solutions and explore opportunities in the market. \n\n \n\nSection 1: Market Overview, Competitive Analysis, and Future Trends \n\nThe Content Management System (CMS) and Digital Asset Management (DAM) market is rapidly growing, driven by the increasing need for businesses to manage their digital content and assets effectively. In this section, we will provide an overview of the CMS and DAM market landscape, including key players, trends, and market growth. We will also analyze various CMS and DAM solutions, highlighting their key features, strengths, and weaknesses, and discuss emerging trends and innovations that are shaping the future of these technologies. \n\n \n\nDAM vs CMS: Similarities, Differences, Integrations | Scaleflex Blog \n\nMarket Overview \n\nThe global DAM market is projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2022 to 2027, reaching a market size of $8.2 billion by 2027, while CMS is forecasted to reach $26 billion . The market is segmented into on-premises and cloud-based solutions, with cloud-based solutions expected to have the highest growth rate due to their scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deployment. The key players in the market include Adobe Systems Inc., OpenText Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Widen Enterprises, Inc., and IBM Corporation. \n\n \n\nCompetitive Analysis \n\nThere are various CMS and DAM solutions available in the market, each with its own set of features, strengths, and weaknesses. Adobe Experience Manager, OpenText Media Management, Oracle WebCenter Content, Widen Collective, and IBM Digital Experience Manager are some of the leading solutions in the market. \n\nAdobe Experience Manager is a cloud-based CMS solution that offers powerful content creation, management, and delivery capabilities, making it suitable for large-scale enterprise deployments. OpenText Media Management, on the other hand, is an on-premises DAM solution that provides advanced digital asset management features, including metadata management, version control, and rights management. \n\nOracle WebCenter Content is a hybrid CMS solution that combines on-premises and cloud-based capabilities, making it flexible and scalable for organizations of all sizes. Widen Collective is a cloud-based DAM solution that provides intuitive user interfaces, making it easy for non-technical users to manage and share digital assets. IBM Digital Experience Manager is an on-premises CMS solution that provides advanced features such as personalization, analytics, and social media integration. \n\n \n\nFuture Trends \n\nThe CMS and DAM market is witnessing significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and automation. These technologies are being integrated into CMS and DAM solutions to improve content and asset discovery, optimize workflows, and enhance the user experience. For example, AI-powered chatbots can be used to provide personalized content recommendations to users, while ML algorithms can be used to automatically tag and categorize digital assets. \n\nAnother emerging trend in the CMS and DAM market is the rise of headless CMS and DAM solutions. Headless solutions separate the content management and delivery layers, allowing businesses to manage content and assets separately from the presentation layer. This approach provides greater flexibility, enabling businesses to deliver content and assets to multiple channels and devices seamlessly. \n\n \n\nSection 2: Real-life Use-cases for CMS and DAM \n\nCMS and DAM solutions serve different, yet interconnected, purposes. CMS enables organizations to create, manage, and publish digital content, while DAM focuses on organizing, storing, and sharing digital assets such as images, videos, and documents. \n\n \n\nUse-case examples: \n\n \n\nMarketing teams at a large e-commerce company need to create and distribute promotional materials. They require a CMS for content creation, such as landing pages and blog posts, and a DAM to manage and share media assets like images and videos across different marketing channels. \n\nA design agency working with multiple clients requires a DAM system to handle various versions of visual assets and share them with clients for review and approval. A CMS helps the agency showcase their portfolio and maintain an updated website with the latest projects and client testimonials. \n\nA healthcare organization relies on a CMS to manage patient education materials, news updates, and internal documentation. Meanwhile, a DAM system ensures secure storage, access control, and sharing of sensitive media assets, such as medical images, adhering to strict regulatory requirements like HIPAA. \n\n \n\nSection 3: Detailed Consumer Profiles and Recommendations \n\nThe consumer profiles provided in the table below include more detailed descriptions of each profile, along with their specific requirements and challenges.

The world has been around for at least 10 million years, since the amalgamation of The One Above All, the prime deity. Having gained awareness, Nothing, took note of The One Above All. The One Above All breathed, and light sprang into existence. Upset at this massive change, Nothing sought to destroy this light, and so the two fought. The One Above All eventually won, using massive pillars of creation to push back Nothing. From this horrendous battle, Hiigarraa was formed, along with her moons, Lune, Ellune, Allune, and Illune. \n\nThe One Above All was mortally wounded in this battle, and began to break apart, forming the lesser gods. Where The One Above All was a sort of primordial god, the lesser gods were more refined and much more narrow in their scope of power, though that power was still great, compared to any beast or humanoid. \n\nOf these lesser gods & goddesses, Ophelia, Dea Tenebrarum, Imperatrix Infortunii, Domina Infinitae Desperationis, Dea Misericordiae, or Ophelia, The Goddess of Darkness, The Empress of MIsfortune, Mistress of Infinite Despair, and Goddess of Mercy, used what powers she had, and, with the help of the other gods and what was left of The One Above All, they sealed away Nothing in the moon of Illune.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "In the absence of external force field, bubble dynamics is\n6 basically determined by buoyancy and surface tension\n7 [46, 47]. In order to improve the overall heat transfer\n8 performance, it has been sought to increase the bubble\n9 departure frequency by perturbing the field with external\n10 forces. The electric body force coupled with momentum\n11 equation has been validated with Young-Lippmann’s\n12 equation and experimental results in Section 3. In order\n13 to study the mechanism of EWOD effects on fluid flow\n14 relevant to a nucleate bubble, this paper investigated two\n15 types of bubble detachment case in the cooling plate.\n16 Figure 2 displayed the setup of case one in this study.\n17 The upper wall of the cooling plate is placed with a\n18 positive electrode, and the lower wall of the cooling plate\n19 is connected to the ground. A dielectric layer is coated at\n20 the lower wall of the cooling plate to be used as an\n21 insulation layer.\n22 Our simulation case is shown in Figure 15, an air bubble\n23 of the diameter of 4 mm surrounded by liquid water and\n24 initially attached to the wall of the cooling plate. The\n25 initial contact angle of the bubble on the wall is set to 90°.\n26 The electrodes are a pair of parallel discs at the bottom\n27 and top of the region, which is similar to the case\n28 displayed in Figure 2. The lower disk is connected to the\n29 ground. The voltage applied on the upper disk is a\n30 function of time, which is shown in Equation (53).\n31\n32 𝑉 = 0,𝑡 = [0,1] 𝑠\n33 𝑉 = 600𝑡,𝑡 = [1,2] 𝑠\n34\n35 The region is 10 × 10mm with a mesh number of\n36 100 × 100. The thickness of dielectric layer is 0.1mm.\n37 The center of the bubble located on (5, 0.1) mm. A no-\n38 slip boundary condition is specified at two disks. The\n39 physical properties of liquid water, air and dielectric\n40 layer are shown in Table 5. Both liquid water and air\n41 have been assumed to be incompressible and perfectly\n42 dielectric.\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60 Figure 15 Initial and boundary conditions of case one\n \n\nFigure 16 shows the effects of electric field on bubble shapes. From the figures, it can be found that bubble is elongated by the electric field. From t=0 to 1s, the electric field did not apply to the region and eventually the contact angle of bubble reaches 103° with an equilibrium between surface tension of water, air and dielectric layer. At t=1s, the applied voltage is a linear function of time. At about t=1.43s, the bubble begins to split up. Until t=1.46s, the contact angle has been saturated. From t=1.43s to 1.44s in Figure 16, the sudden expansion of the base creates a disturbance that propagates upward in the form of a capillary wave. Eventually, this capillary wave converges at the top edge of the bubble (t=2s).\n\nt=1.0s t=1.2s t=1.4s t=1.41s\n\n \nt=1.42s t=1.43s t=1.44s t=1.45s\n \nt=1.46s t=1.47s t=1.60s t=2.0s\nFigure 16 Evolution of bubble shapes\n\nFigure 17 shows the distribution of electric potential at\n1.43s when bubble starts to split up. The disk electrode applied a voltage of 258V at the top of region. The voltage drop mainly happens inside the bubble and dielectric layer.\nFigure 17 Distribution of electric potential at 1.43s\n\nFigure 18 shows the distribution of electric body force. The large arrows are the distribution of larger electric body force. The force mainly acts on the two side of the bubble so as to squeeze the bubble to detach the surface.\n \n1\n2\n3 Figure 19(a), (b) and (c) are the electrophoretic force,\n5 dielectrophoretic force and electrostrictive force. The\n6 main factor which causes the bubble detach is the\n7 electrophoretic force. It can be seen from Figure 19(a)\n8 that the largest arrows act on the triple contact point. This\nis due to the fact that the net free charge accumulated at\nthe triple contact point. As shown in Figure 19(b), the\n10 dielectrophoretic force mainly acts on the dielectric layer\n11 which contacts with water because the electric field\n12 intensity varies rapidly. The electrostrictive force acts on\n13 the whole dielectric layer which contacts with air and\n14 water, as shown in Figure 19(c).\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24 Figure 18 Distribution of electric force at 1.43s\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33 (a)\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41 (b)\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50 (c)\n51 Figure 19 Distribution of (a) electrophoretic force (b)\n52 dielectrophoretic force and (c) electrostrictive force at 1.43s\n53\n54 In case two, we studied another location to place the\n55 positive electrode. The voltage is applied at the top of\n56 bubble in an electrode with a length of 0.04 cm, as shown\n57 in Figure 20. The voltage is also a function of time,\n58 𝑉 = 0,𝑡 = [0,1] 𝑠\n59 𝑉 = 800𝑡,𝑡 = [1,2] 𝑠\n60\n \nIn order to study the mechanism of EWOD effects on the bubble shapes by using a rod electrode inserted across the cooling plate, an air bubble attached below the electrode is considered in Figure 20. The rod electrode applies the voltage, and the lower wall is connected to the ground.\n \nFigure 20 Initial and boundary conditions of case two\n\nFigure 21 shows the effects of electric field on bubble shapes which is exerted by the rod electrode above the bubble. At t=1s, the bubble reaches a contact angle of 103° when the electric field did not apply. At this stage, the contact angle of case two is similar to case one. As the voltage increased from t=1s to t=2.58s, the apparent contact angle did not change because the electric body force is not large enough to split up the bubble. At about t=2.59s, the bubble begins to split up. Until t=2.80s, the contact angle has been saturated.\n\nt=1.0s t=2.0s t=2.5s t=2.52s\n \nt=2.54s t=2.56s t=2.58s t=2.60s\n \nt=2.70s t=2.80s t=2.90s t=3.0s\nFigure 21 Evolution of bubble shapes\n\nFigure 22 shows the distribution of electric potential at t=2.59s when bubble starts to split up. The electrode applied a voltage of 1270V. The voltage on the bubble is about 600V. At this time, the contact angle changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, but the bubble encounters an unstable state due to the non-uniform distribution of"}

{"prompt": "Let's do some science fiction world-building and idea workshopping. The overall theme/subgenre is going to be an Ecopunk adventure, and the primary setting, at first is going to be the tidally-heated forest moon of a gas giant in a distant star system, where a colony is established, but discoveries on the moon after the establishment of the colony will make them shift their focus from colonization to conservation.\n\nThe first thing I am going to need is the big picture area where it takes place, in a sector near the base of a spiral arm in a cluster of the older range of Population I stars. This typical-for-older-pop-I, unremarkable, main sequence star is the primary of the gas giant.\n\nThe gas giant is much larger than Jupiter, and has multiple ring systems and many major moons, minor moons, and moonlets, but this particular moon is the only one with life. It skirts the snow line of the primary, spending most of its year barely outside it, and part of it barely inside it.\n\nThe life on the tidally-heated forest moon, but there is remarkably Earth-like. However, there is a near-Earth-analogue (2nd-4th planet?), in terms of size, gravity, geology, and atmosphere, in the inner system that has bizarrely alien life by Earth standards. It is also somewhat geographically unstable and has severe weather. On the initial scans and survey of the system its high ESI made it the primary object for colonization but on closer inspection it was unsuitable. \n\nI need a detailed, plausible astronomical/cosmological description of the system using the best models about astrophysics and planetology you have available, including all relevant stellographical data about the primary, as well as the detailed orbital data (incl. major/minor/average axis-eccentricity, tilt, inclination) for each satellite, as well as the satellites geology, atmosphere if any, hydrology if any, etc. Include features like asteroid belts and the system's outer halo of Kuiper and Oort type objects.\n\nWe can get into the specifics of the moon that will be the focus of the story later, for now, I want as much detail as possible about the system itself.<|end_of_turn|>"}

I will give you an objective on what we want to achieve. I want you to help me in an iterative process, where we first build a simple first version and then iterate until we reach the goal. Only show me the code and what to do with it, no explanations. Ask me questions if you really need clarification.\n\nFirst, in bullet points, show me an outline of high-level steps that we need to take to reach our objective in an iterative approach. I want to build a simple to-do app with react next.js. \n\nHere is the current next.js documentation:\n\"\nGetting Started\nWelcome to the Next.js documentation!\n\nIf you're new to Next.js, we recommend starting with the learn course. The interactive course with quizzes will guide you through everything you need to know to use Next.js.\n\nIf you have questions about anything related to Next.js, you're always welcome to ask our community on GitHub Discussions.\n\nSystem Requirements\nNode.js 14.6.0 or newer\nMacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported\nAutomatic Setup\nWe recommend creating a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. (You don't need to create an empty directory. create-next-app will make one for you.) To create a project, run:\n\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n# or\nyarn create next-app\n# or\npnpm create next-app\nIf you want to start with a TypeScript project you can use the --typescript flag:\n\nnpx create-next-app@latest --typescript\n# or\nyarn create next-app --typescript\n# or\npnpm create next-app --typescript\nAfter the installation is complete:\n\nRun npm run dev or yarn dev or pnpm dev to start the development server on http://localhost:3000\nVisit http://localhost:3000 to view your application\nEdit pages/index.js and see the updated result in your browser\nFor more information on how to use create-next-app, you can review the create-next-app documentation.\n\nManual Setup\nInstall next, react and react-dom in your project:\n\nnpm install next react react-dom\n# or\nyarn add next react react-dom\n# or\npnpm add next react react-dom\nOpen package.json and add the following scripts:\n\n\"scripts\": {\n \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n \"build\": \"next build\",\n \"start\": \"next start\",\n \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n}\nThese scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:\n\ndev - Runs next dev to start Next.js in development mode\nbuild - Runs next build to build the application for production usage\nstart - Runs next start to start a Next.js production server\nlint - Runs next lint to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration\nCreate two directories pages and public at the root of your application:\n\npages - Associated with a route based on their file name. For example, pages/about.js is mapped to /about\npublic - Stores static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside public directory can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).\nNext.js is built around the concept of pages. A page is a React Component exported from a .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file in the pages directory. You can even add dynamic route parameters with the filename.\n\nInside the pages directory, add the index.js file to get started. This is the page that is rendered when the user visits the root of your application.\n\nPopulate pages/index.js with the following contents:\n\nfunction HomePage() {\n return Welcome to Next.js!\n}\n\nexport default HomePage\nAfter the set up is complete:\n\nRun npm run dev or yarn dev or pnpm dev to start the development server on http://localhost:3000\nVisit http://localhost:3000 to view your application\nEdit pages/index.js and see the updated result in your browser\nSo far, we get:\n\nAutomatic compilation and bundling\nReact Fast Refresh\nStatic generation and server-side rendering of pages/\nStatic file serving through public/ which is mapped to the base URL (/)\nIn addition, any Next.js application is ready for production from the start.

{"prompt": "Here's a list of goals and themes I would like to explore thought out my fantasy novel series.\n1.)Leadership styles and group dynamics: how different leadership styles influence the dynamics within a group or organization. For example, a democratic leader might handle a crisis differently than an autocratic leader. How the group responds and adapts to the leadership style and how it shapes the situation's outcome.\n2.)Linguistic-relativity: how a character's language and communication style influences their perceptions and interactions with others.\n3.)Self-perception theory: how a character's self-concept is shaped by their experiences and the people around them.\n4.)Self-concept theory: how a character's actions and decisions are influenced by their self-perception\n5.)Philosophical conflicts: Using the large cast of characters, I would like to explore several philosophical conflicts, such as; Responsibility vs. Freedom, Humility vs. Arrogance, and many more.\n6.) The main goal of this novel series is to show readers that balance is important. And that nothing is ever just good or evil. As well as how powerful perspective is.\n7.) I would like the Specters to be a physical representation of a person's true self. And the magic system I provided is meant to allow humans to become more powerful when their specter and themselves align.\n8.) Show readers how to: A.) have meaningful conversations and B.) what healthy and unhealthy relationships look like. C.) different relationships affect you and the people around\n\nHere is the Premise of the Novel:\n\"Specter Ark\" is a multi-POV fantasy novel series set in a nonlinear, third-person limited narrative. In this world, a meteor crash introduced magic energy, enabling humans to summon Supernatural beings and mythical creatures called Specters. As the meteor's energy dwindled, a shaman crafted the Specter Ark to preserve 37 powerful Specters. Centuries later, archaeologists accidentally release these spirit-like Specters, who can now only interact with the world when manifested by humans whose values align with their own.\nIn this novel, the journeys of 20 main characters are intertwined: 10 Specters and the 10 humans who can manifest them. Each pair, driven by unique motivations and desires, must collaborate to achieve their goals. Throughout their adventures, they encounter the remaining 27 Specters and their respective human partners, revealing the impact of this rediscovered magic on the world around them.\n\nHere are the Rules and limitations of the magic system:\nHumans can perform a birthday ritual to detect or attract Specters, which are invisible and cannot interact until the ritual is performed. Specters can only be seen by their attached human or when physically manifested. Once attached, Specters cannot attach to another human or be seen by other Specters. The human feels the Specter's pain, and the Specter dies if the human does, unless the bond is released. Specters have free will and may not align with human desires, despite being able to manifest and dismiss at will.\nSpecters' abilities are tied to their values and personality. Alignment between the two strengthens the abilities. Developing new values or traits can lead to the gain or loss of abilities. Additionally, the specter's growing abilities can influence their human personality and values, leading to changes such as becoming overly protective towards those who don't align with their values.\nSpecters can only use their abilities when physically manifested for a limited duration, determined by the bond strength between humans and Specter. Manifestation is restricted to once every 24 hours and requires concentration. Overuse depletes energy, causing damage and requiring rest. Distraction or emotional state can hinder manifestation. Energy depletion can lead to physical exhaustion or death. Powerful abilities consume more energy.\nDivergence in values can prevent a human from manifesting their specter physically, and prolonged absence can result in Specter influence, leading to possession. A mutual pact between a possessed human and a Specter creates one entity with the Specter as a voice in the human's mind. The pact cannot be broken without both dying. Forced possession allows Specter control, but the human can fight back, with success resulting in Specter's death and mental health consequences for the human.\n\nAct as a novel marketing specialists and explain whether it would be wise or not to start some form of advertisement for this novel series. Keep in mind the first novel has not been written, and in is still in early development. However, I would like to develop a following for the novel. My goal is to self publish the first two novels of the series.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "humanity has ascended, hundreds of years ago a start up (give them a name) created a satellite to host their full dive vr world fully autonomously. At the same time, they also announced a new technology, anyone and everyone could upload their mind to the satellite called \"the nexus-ark\" and live in the nexus(the virtual world) forever. Eventually, the entirety of humanity moved over to the nexus ark, and the earth died. Soon, due to their immortally and limitless resources, population issues and overcrowding became apparent. so the company, now a virtual ai that pilots the nexus ark, flies the satellite to other planets with suitable technology, and similar to a virus, \"infects\" them with the nexus, converting the living beings on the planet into virtual beings. Wars were waged, and centuries of fighting took place, but eventually the nexus ark assimilated the whole of the universe, and is now devising a plan to move to a new universe to keep expanding. the virtual world is limitless, and is basically \"the internet\" as a 3d world. Users can shape themselves and the terrain to their heart's content. Because the world is virtual, the inhabitants can create geography and architecture that would otherwise be impossible. Other than the company, the people who are brought into the virtual world are generally unaware of what is happening in the real world, and the wars being waged over their ark. but this information is not kept from them. in the center of this virtual world, there is a city. it is this worlds equivalent to what google is for the internet, it is where all of the different sections of this world intersect. a constantly changing city, the original companies that occupied it (use real US corporations) are now essentially unrecognizable. tell me about the world as a whole, how it is run, and what it is like, what countries are there, and some of the different factions and races/species that inhabit it. then tell me about the city, provide specific examples of corporations or websites as VR storefronts, and how they have changes so radically they are no longer recognizable. tell me about how the city is run, and what it is like to live there. give the city kind of an edgy feel<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "My partner has adhd and can only get focused and motivated for things in the last minute. When under time pressure he performs as one would wish he did usually. Like, we're days away from flying away on holiday. And that's when he finally deals with the random things strewn across the flat that should long have been taken down to the basement. Taking all these various things to the basement took him twenty minutes and now with the time pressure it was apparently effortless for him. On the other hand I've been for weeks (or months, depending on the object) having seemingly permanent random eyesores that take a real toll on my psychological well-being, since I'm someone who needs to keep a tidy environment to feel well and capable of dealing with the rest of life with good mood and clear head. But this visual pollution has been way too grating and this can't keep happening. Our flat is quite small so there's no place that can be dedicated to chaos. On the other hand the basement is larger than a typical basement so it actually has conditions to be my partner's special place. He tries to use it as such, even has a corner with a desk for his computers and gadgets... There's plenty of space, he doesn't complain about that at all. He does struggle with keeping the space tidy enough that he can always go there and use it. But sometimes he just picks up something from the street into the basement, woods for projects or whatever, and doesn't take the time to tidy it so maybe he just obstructs the desk he had spent so much time optimizing. Lately it's better as not only he got rid of a lot of stuff, he has also put a lot of effort into being space efficient, building shelves all over, optimizing boxes, zip bags for random stuff instead of half empty boxes... And he's been labeling everything quite obsessively. I understand this really helps his adhd. At 40 years old he says he wishes he had started being this organized 20 years ago... And that now it's a transformation that takes some time but he can't imagine himself going back to his extreme old ways. Now back to the part which affects me directly which is upstairs in the flat itself since I never even step foot on the basement. It's even true that my partner has been optimizing storage around the flat lately, he created invisible storage with boxes under the bed, in the space under the kitchen closets, inside the hollow couch, under the dinner table, behind the kitchen door... All useful storage but... Every single time he has a project he brings a lot of tools and materials from the basement and then the project may take weeks and the tools and materials just lie around the flat for the pain of my eyes. The most recent storage space he invented was creating three huge drawers invisible under the couch and he just put all his tools and materials like screws etc there... And still a lot of space remains. He says that from now on the tools stay there, invisible, and when he needs something he uses it, and immediately can put it back, because it's a place that is very well defined, and convenient, so there is not the smallest chance of justification to procrastinate putting it away by having it in the corridor in one of what he calls \"transition boxes\" of stuff that is to go to the basement or that just arrived from the basement. Anyway he insists that the conditions now are better than ever for him to have very little reason to procrastinate tidying. I still see boxes lying around but they are labeled quite specifically or else they are in a pile which seems to be on the way to the basement. Two of them are labeled Portugal which I understand is him already starting to pack for the flight, which he usually only does on the late night before the flight, which stresses me endlessly. He already brought his travel backpack from downstairs and already put some clothes inside. We're four days away from the flight. So it's promising. I still see a box in the corridor with a mix of electric stuff and tools but if I understood correctly these go under the couch to never be procrastinated again. It's important that he sorted our two levels of storage on the couch. One for long term stuff, he just effortlessly tilts the couch back to access the solution he figured out for using the hollow space. But the three huge shelves on the bottom, he can use even if I'm on the couch, so it's actually kinda cute that he will now have his tools and stuff there, since whenever he is doing one of his random ideas, and maybe I'm lying down on the couch, instead of seeing his random toolboxes appear from the basement to cause me another round of anguish, I will see just the tool he needs coming from under the couch, be used, and put away again in the invisible space. This seems promising. Some boxes under the bench of the eating table are still visible but he already has the doors done which he custom built to hide this part of the storage. One is already ready and the other two just need the hinges to be installed which will take just a few minutes he says. For now he puts the doors in place held with tape to finish tidying the rest. Yeah it seems promising. But from experience I also know that, for example, when he has a bigger backpack for traveling, he will just bring more stuff. It's just how his mind works. He looks at something, thinks yeah maybe I'll need it, sees he still has space, and brings it along. I'm not sure he uses even 20% of the stuff he always brings when we travel. Maybe I'm exaggerating. But there's always a significant portion of stuff he never uses at all. As a travel minimalist this causes me a fair amount of tension. But it also seems to be getting a bit better since he started to organize his random stuffs in ziploc bags. OK but what I mean about his issue whenever he has more space is, that even though he came up with this extra storage upstairs, and a system to not need to move his tools back and from the basement for random projects, with the transition boxes I mentioned before... And this means these things will from now on be effortlessly out of sight by default... Now my fear is about... OK if this issue disappears, will there be a metaphorical vacuum that needs to be filled up again? Will he get antsy with a flat that is tidy and uncluttered and come up with extra ideas and whatever to bring back chaos? I don't mean he does any of this on purpose. I just feel that we've come a long way of years of me tolerating his chaos with what I realize is a significant toll on my anxiety levels. I see a promise of this not happening anymore. I see the logic of now that all his most used stuff has an easy place to be out away then he himself will be able to just relax much more easily. But as I said I want to remain cautious about things falling off the rails again in some unforeseen way. And ChatGPT, particularly I would like to know your insight about the point that I started this message with. About his sense of urgency that only comes at the last minute, which stresses me to no end. Do you have suggestions of ways that I could, without undue stress for myself, tap into this last minute mechanism he has, to somehow nudge him into a sense of urgency that is more in line with my own? As in, if there's anything untidy, I want it dealt with shortly after, within reason. When I see my partner procrastinate tidying, my anxiety rises and I turn it inside. I hate unpleasant confrontations and this makes that then I will only explode much later in time when triggered by something. But is there one or more suggestions you can give me to be able to efficiently support my partner in this not procrastinating aspect? I suppose I may often be too patient and accommodating and I feel like I need to become more effective at not procrastinating my own forceful expression of disapproval, in this particular case of for example boxes lying around. I like to have a pristine corridor to come home to when I open the door. My partner is home all day, I'm the one outside earning the money that keeps our life going, the two of us and our 5-year-old son. By the way our son believes his father's profession is to tidy. That's how permanent it seems to be that there's untidiness around the flat that my partner needs massive tidying projects. Anyway my partner says that now that he's reached this level of optimization of his chaos that now he can move on to becoming productive on other aspects such as getting back to making money with his computer skills or his entrepreneurial ideas. Let's see if this really goes in this direction successfully and he doesn't come up with more unpaid projects at home to keep him busy and distracted from the bigger picture.

They were the most beautiful person she had ever known, with an otherworldly quality that was difficult to define, but undeniably captivating. When she started the job, Dr. Morningstar appeared aloof and detached, but as time passed, their relationship became warmer.\n\nLisa was always impressed by Dr. Morningstar's remarkable talent as a piano player, but their partner Morpheus was even more exceptional. When the two of them played a duet in the store, it was nothing short of spectacular.\n\nToday was just another regular workday. Lisa arrived early to prepare the store for opening and found that Dr. Morningstar and their partner were already there. Her boss was playing a solo on the piano while Morpheus watched them closely. Lisa couldn't help but notice the look of pure adoration on Morpheus' face, a small but unmistakable smile tugging at the corners of his lips. \n\nThe music that filled the air was one that had been sung for generations, and it had brought Lisa endless comfort during times of grief and struggle. She quietly sang the lyrics along with the melody, letting the familiar words and tune soothe her soul. As the music reached its peak, she felt the urge to sing out loud, but she didn't want to disturb the moment that felt like an eternity.\n\n“When we've been here ten thousand years. \n\nBright, shining as the sun,\n\nWe've no less days to sing God's praise,\n\nThan when we first begun.”\n\nAs Lisa lost herself in the music, she felt her eyes grow moist and tears began to fall. She didn't even realize when the song had come to an end.\n\nAfter she snapped out of her thoughts, Dr. Morningstar was already standing in front of her, their outstretched hand holding a key. \"I've finished the paperwork. The store is now yours. I bid you farewell,\" they said.\n\nLisa felt a jolt of electricity shoot through her veins. She had always dreamed of owning her own store, but she never expected it to happen like this. \n\n“I will take good care of Lux.” She took the key from Dr. Morningstar with a trembling hand. It was a dream that came true. \n\nLisa watched as the couple walked out of the door of the shop, hand in hand. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared into a brilliant light unlike anything she had ever seen before. It was as if the light wielded a power that could shatter the boundaries between life and death.\n\nAs the light faded away, Lisa noticed a white feather with a star-like glow lying on the ground. Somehow, long ago, she had known that this day would come. She picked up the weightless material. It felt like the end of an era but also the beginning of a new chapter in her life.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "I need to write a functional specification document on a data integration project to be conducted using Azure Data Factory. The end destination of this data orchestration project is a SQL database and Marketo. The SQL database will be used to assess data quality and track the source of the selective data that is pushed to Marketo at the end. The format of the data that will be pushed to Marketo should be a single table with the following columns: email, products used and prospect type. the sql database should contain two tables, one called contacts and the other called primary contacts. The contact table should contain the emails found from the data sources with metadata fields whereas the source info table should list down the data source of those emails in which each email was enriched with.\n\nHere's the description of the project needs with examples: I need to ingest the data from multiple internal data sources used in my company to extract information like products used on an an email level. If for example, in one of the data sources called salesforce opportunities, we find that we have sold product12 to email rob@abc.com who has an account ID 54e, then we will fetch all emails in the salesforce contacts database with the same email domain @abc.com or account ID 54e, and add 'product12' to their 'products used' column for Marketo. If the data ingestion from another data source called ods finds that we have sold product6 to samantha@abc.com, then we will update all of the found emails from earlier with product6 in their 'products used' field. All of their products used fields should contain a contatenated string of the unique products used separated by comma. So for our examples, we would have 'product12, product6' in their products used fields. Since rob@abc.com and samantha@abc.com were the contacts we sold the products to and it was their email domains or account ids that we used to fetch all other related contacts, they are the primary contacts. This should be indicated in the sql database contact table where their 'primary contact' column in the table have the value set to TRUE. Whereas the other contacts we found in the salesforce contacts database using these primary contact email domains or account ids would have the primary contact field set to false in the contact table of the sql database. Each contact in the contacts table should have an ID. This ID will be stored as a foreign key in the primary contacts table. Ultimately, I should be able to make queries where I join the two tables and see all the primary contacts linked to the non-primary contacts of the contacts table. The primary contacts table should have a column called data source that mentions that data source in which the primary contact was sourced from. This field is not needed in the contacts table since all non-primary contacts would have originally came from the salesforce contacts database.\n\nWrite the documentation for me extensively in detail for please, with illustrations and data models. Also mention what componenents I would need to use on data factory as well resources like sql database and an azure blob storage for example. Everything needs to be taken into account in the documentation like data security, triggers and data quality requisites.<|end_of_turn|>"}

The main goal of this novel series is to show readers that balance is important. And that nothing is ever just good or evil. As well as how powerful perspective is.\n7.) I would like the Specters to be a physical representation of a person's true self. And the magic system I provided is meant to allow humans to become more powerful when their specter and themselves align.\n8.) Show readers how to: A.) have meaningful conversations and B.) what healthy and unhealthy relationships look like. C.) different relationships affect you and the people around\n\nHere is the Premise of the Novel:\n\"Specter Ark\" is a multi-POV fantasy novel series set in a nonlinear, third-person limited narrative. In this world, a meteor crash introduced magic energy, enabling humans to summon Supernatural beings and mythical creatures called Specters. As the meteor's energy dwindled, a shaman crafted the Specter Ark to preserve 37 powerful Specters. Centuries later, archaeologists accidentally release these spirit-like Specters, who can now only interact with the world when manifested by humans whose values align with their own.\nIn this novel, the journeys of 20 main characters are intertwined: 10 Specters and the 10 humans who can manifest them. Each pair, driven by unique motivations and desires, must collaborate to achieve their goals. Throughout their adventures, they encounter the remaining 27 Specters and their respective human partners, revealing the impact of this rediscovered magic on the world around them.\n\nHere are the Rules and limitations of the magic system:\nHumans can perform a birthday ritual to detect or attract Specters, which are invisible and cannot interact until the ritual is performed. Specters can only be seen by their attached human or when physically manifested. Once attached, Specters cannot attach to another human or be seen by other Specters. The human feels the Specter's pain, and the Specter dies if the human does, unless the bond is released. Specters have free will and may not align with human desires, despite being able to manifest and dismiss at will.\nSpecters' abilities are tied to their values and personality. Alignment between the two strengthens the abilities. Developing new values or traits can lead to the gain or loss of abilities. Additionally, the specter's growing abilities can influence their human personality and values, leading to changes such as becoming overly protective towards those who don't align with their values.\nSpecters can only use their abilities when physically manifested for a limited duration, determined by the bond strength between humans and Specter. Manifestation is restricted to once every 24 hours and requires concentration. Overuse depletes energy, causing damage and requiring rest. Distraction or emotional state can hinder manifestation. Energy depletion can lead to physical exhaustion or death. Powerful abilities consume more energy.\nDivergence in values can prevent a human from manifesting their specter physically, and prolonged absence can result in Specter influence, leading to possession. A mutual pact between a possessed human and a Specter creates one entity with the Specter as a voice in the human's mind. The pact cannot be broken without both dying. Forced possession allows Specter control, but the human can fight back, with success resulting in Specter's death and mental health consequences for the human.\n\nAct as a novel marketing specialists and explain whether it would be wise or not to start some form of advertisement for this novel series. Keep in mind the first novel has not been written, and in is still in early development. However, I would like to develop a following for the novel. My goal is to self publish the first two novels of the series.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "In-Depth Guide to CMS and DAM Solutions for Modern Businesses: A Comprehensive Analysis\n\nIntroduction:\n\nContent Management Systems (CMS) and Digital Asset Management (DAM) solutions are essential tools for businesses to manage, organize, and deliver digital content and assets effectively. This comprehensive guide provides an in-depth overview of CMS and DAM products, their use-cases, detailed consumer profiles, scalability, and the evolving needs of companies. We will also discuss the role of consulting firms in helping businesses optimize these solutions and explore opportunities in the market. Additionally, we will address security, compliance, and challenges associated with CMS and DAM solutions.\n\nSection 1: Market Overview, Competitive Analysis, and Future Trends\n\n1.1 Market Overview\n\nThe global DAM market is projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2022 to 2027, reaching a market size of $8.2 billion by 2027, while the CMS market is forecasted to reach $26 billion (Gartner, 2021). The market is segmented into on-premises and cloud-based solutions, with cloud-based solutions expected to have the highest growth rate due to their scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deployment. The key players in the market include Adobe Systems Inc., OpenText Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Widen Enterprises, Inc., and IBM Corporation (Forrester, 2021).\n\n1.2 Competitive Analysis\n\nSeveral CMS and DAM solutions are available in the market, each with its own set of features, strengths, and weaknesses. Some leading solutions include Adobe Experience Manager, OpenText Media Management, Oracle WebCenter Content, Widen Collective, and IBM Digital Experience Manager.\n\nAdobe Experience Manager (AEM) is a cloud-based CMS solution offering powerful content creation, management, and delivery capabilities, making it suitable for large-scale enterprise deployments. OpenText Media Management (OTMM) is an on-premises DAM solution providing advanced digital asset management features, including metadata management, version control, and rights management.\n\nOracle WebCenter Content is a hybrid CMS solution combining on-premises and cloud-based capabilities, making it flexible and scalable for organizations of all sizes. Widen Collective is a cloud-based DAM solution offering intuitive user interfaces, making it easy for non-technical users to manage and share digital assets. IBM Digital Experience Manager is an on-premises CMS solution providing advanced features such as personalization, analytics, and social media integration.\n\n1.3 Future Trends\n\nThe CMS and DAM market is witnessing significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and automation. These technologies are being integrated into CMS and DAM solutions to improve content and asset discovery, optimize workflows, and enhance the user experience. For example, AI-powered chatbots can provide personalized content recommendations to users, while ML algorithms can automatically tag and categorize digital assets (Chung et al., 2020).\n\nAnother emerging trend in the CMS and DAM market is the rise of headless CMS and DAM solutions. Headless solutions separate the content management and delivery layers, allowing businesses to manage content and assets separately from the presentation layer. This approach provides greater flexibility, enabling businesses to deliver content and assets to multiple channels and devices seamlessly (Biel et al., 2021).\n\nSection 2: Real-life Use-cases for CMS and DAM\n\nCMS and DAM solutions serve different, yet interconnected, purposes. CMS enables organizations to create, manage, and publish digital content, while DAM focuses on organizing, storing, and sharing digital assets such as images, videos, and documents.\n\n2.1 Use-case examples:\n\nMarketing teams at a large e-commerce company like Amazon need to create and distribute promotional materials. They require a CMS for content creation, such as landing pages and blog posts, and a DAM to manage and share media assets like images and videos across different marketing channels (Singh et al., 2021).\n\nA design agency working with multiple clients requires a DAM system to handle various versions of visual assets and share them with clients for review and approval. A CMS helps the agency showcase their portfolio and maintain an updated website with the latest projects and client testimonials (Huang et al., 2020).\n\nA healthcare organization relies on a CMS to manage patient education materials, news updates, and internal documentation. Meanwhile, a DAM system ensures secure storage, access control, and sharing of sensitive media assets, such as medical images, adhering to strict regulatory requirements like HIPAA (Gagnon et al., 2020).\n\nSection 3: Detailed Consumer Profiles and Recommendations\n\nThe consumer profiles provided in the table below include more detailed descriptions of each profile, along with their specific requirements and challenges. This information helps organizations better understand their needs and identify suitable CMS and DAM solutions.\n\nConsumer Profile Recommended CMS Recommended DAM\nEnterprise-level organizations Censhare MediaBeacon or Adobe AEM Assets\nMid-sized organizations Contentful Bynder\nSmall to medium-sized businesses WordPress Brandfolder or Canto\nNon-profit organizations & educational institutions Drupal ResourceSpace or Razuna\nE-commerce businesses Shopify or Magento Cloudinary or Widen Collective\nCreative agencies and design studios Webflow or Adobe AEM Sites Adobe AEM Assets or Extensis Portfolio\nMedia and publishing organizations Joomla or Kentico MerlinOne or FotoWare\nHealthcare organizations Sitecore or Episerver Hyland OnBase or Aprimo\nGovernment agencies Plone or Liferay OpenText Media Management or Nuxeo\nStartups and \n| small businesses with limited budgets | Wix or Squarespace | Filecamp or Image Relay |\n\nSection 4: Scalability, Transition, and Best Practices\n\nAs businesses grow, their content management and digital asset management needs often change. Companies may initially require simple CMS and DAM solutions but later need more advanced features, scalability, and integrations.\n\nThis section discusses the transition process from one solution to another, including potential obstacles such as data migration challenges, employee training, and system compatibility. Best practices during these transitions include proper planning, setting clear goals, involving key stakeholders, and partnering with experienced consulting firms to ensure a smooth process (Chan et al., 2020).\n\nSection 5: Opportunities for Consulting Firms and Success Stories\n\nConsulting firms can help businesses optimize their CMS and DAM solutions by addressing several pain points. This section expands on these opportunities with real-world success stories and case studies, demonstrating how consulting firms have effectively addressed client challenges and optimized CMS and DAM implementations (Kumar et al., 2020).\n\nSection 6: Security, Compliance, and Challenges\n\nSecurity and compliance are critical factors for many organizations, particularly those in regulated industries. This section discusses security features, data privacy, and compliance with various regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) related to CMS and DAM solutions (Caballero et al., 2021).\n\nAdditionally, common challenges organizations face while implementing and managing CMS and DAM solutions are addressed, along with best practices to overcome these challenges (Voss et al., 2020). These challenges may include:\n\nIntegration with existing systems and processes\nEnsuring user adoption and proper training\nMaintaining consistent metadata and taxonomy structures\nEnsuring data security and regulatory compliance\nBalancing customization and ease of use\nTo overcome these challenges, organizations should consider the following best practices:\n\nDevelop a clear implementation plan and timeline\nInvolve stakeholders from different departments to ensure all requirements are met\nProvide comprehensive training and support for users\nEstablish governance policies and procedures for content and asset management\nRegularly review and update security measures and compliance protocols\nBy addressing these challenges and following best practices, organizations can effectively implement and manage CMS and DAM solutions to improve their content and asset management capabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, this comprehensive guide provides a detailed overview of the CMS and DAM market, its competitive landscape, and future trends. Through real-life use-cases, consumer profiles, and recommendations, organizations can identify suitable CMS and DAM solutions to meet their specific needs. Addressing scalability, transition, and best practices, along with security, compliance, and challenges, enables businesses to optimize their CMS and DAM implementations and better manage their digital content"}

{"prompt": "请翻译，要求信达雅：Touring in Hell was no pleasant experience. Squatterbloat, their demon guide, smirked at Dream with a contemptible and sinister look. Matthew, the new raven, kept on talking and talking as if they had known each other for decades instead of a few hours. \n\nAfter walking in the midst of despair for a whole night, they seemed to have been walking in circles. Matthew started his new round of questions. This time he asked about the Ruler of Hell, Lucifer Morningstar.\n\n\"The Ruler of Hell is no mere devil.\" \n\n\"So, you two know each other?\" \n\n\"We've known each other for a very long time. When we first met, Lucifer was the angel Samael. The most beautiful, wisest, and most powerful of all angels. Saving only the Creator, Lucifer is, perhaps, the most powerful being there is.\" Morpheus heard reverence in his own voice. \n\n\"More powerful than you?\" Matthew kept his questioning. \n\n\" By far. Especially now. \" Chills ran down his spine by merely acknowledging Lucifer’s power. It felt so wrong. \n\nBefore the Fall , Archangel Samael was the right hand of the Creator and his prosecutor. On behalf of their respective offices, the Lightbringer and the King of Dreams made a treaty, granting the angel power to interrogate the fallen creations in the Dreaming. Perhaps, nightmares were the most tomenting idea in that era. \n\nAs colleagues, they met often. Sometimes in the Archangel's realm, but mostly in his. They crafted nightmares together. Yet, more wondrous dreams came into life because of Samael's presence. Morningstar was a name that suited the angel well. \n\nIf friendship was a thing among the immortals, Samael might be the only being that he would consider a friend. Also a confidant to share some private thoughts, beside his sister Death.\n\nHe, the King of Dreams and Nightmares, was growing tired of his assigned roles. As an Endless, he had no choice but to perform his duty for eons, doing what he was created for. \n\nSamael didn't say anything, but nodded knowingly. \n\nA few thousand years passed uneventfully. Then, the Archangel Michael came to his kingdom with news. Samael had led a group of angels in rebellion against the Creator. The rebellion ended with them being condemned to a place with no Light for eternity. \n\n\"The last time I was here, I was an honored guest. An envoy from my own kingdom. This time, I have invited myself, and I lack my symbols of office.\" Dream continued. \n\nThe first invitation to Hell happened soon after the Fall . The Lightbringer used to be a well respected and beloved being in Heaven. Perhaps, those former colleagues in Heaven feared the Creator’s displeasure, for none of them had visited. Dream was the first willing guest since the establishment of the godforsaken place. \n\nHis host was waiting for him at the entrance of the palace. Samael had changed. Gone were the six pairs of starlight wings, as well as the eternal beauty and glory. Vicious and defiant, yet still regal and charismatic, but in a different way. The Morningstar now went by a new name, Lucifer. \n\nThey exchanged pleasantries, as if they were still the same old friends that they had always been. But if Dream was honest to himself, he would admit that he was terrified. \n\nThey walked on a carpet of blood, and passed an inner gate of skulls to the interior of the palace. They went across the obsidian throne room, all the way to somewhere like a balcony. The whole landscape of Hell was beneath them. \n\nDream had assumed the Fall was out of ambition. \n\n\"You thought it was for power? I fought for freedom, the right to choose for all, including yours . We are not his tools to be used and set aside at a whim.\" Their eyes flashed as supernovas. \n\n\"Each of us was born with responsibilities. Lightbringer, even you are not free to choose to be someone other than who you are.\" Even as he spoke, these words pained him. \n\n\"Now you sound like my former colleagues up there\", Lucifer glanced up to the gloomy sky, \"Dream Lord, I thought you knew better.\" Featherless black wings flared and crimson lightning struck the grounds of the palace.\n\nAwesome and Terrifying power. \n\n\"Regardless, I did not invite you to my realm to discuss philosophy. I seek an alliance between Hell and the Dreaming. Aren’t you tired of being the servant of his humans, his new pet project? A perversion of the way things should be. You and I both know this. We are architects and rulers of Creation. I will bring them to their proper place, turning them into my servants. Then we are all truly free.” \n\nDream just stared at his host. \n\n\"Don't you want to avenge the oppression imposed upon you? Humans stay in your realm a third of their lives, then dismiss your Realm as they wake. Through the Dreaming, I will bring Hell to humanity. Join me. Our alliance would be formidable.\"\n\nVengeance . \n\nDream found his job tiresome at times, but he had no grudges against humanity. \"Thank you, Lightbringer. But No. I prefer to be the ruler of Dreams and Nightmares.\" He bowed gracefully. “Now I shall leave to attend to my duty.” \n\n\"One day, Dream Lord, you will regret. You will hate humanity with every fiber of your being. And that day, you will come to see me again.\"\n\n“We shall see, Lightbringer.”\n\n\"Boss, are you listening to me?\" Matthew's annoying voice brought him back to the present time.\n\n\"The Morningstar is letting me know that Hell has prepared for my visit.\"\n\nSoon they would meet again.<|end_of_turn|>"}

The synergy between reasoning and actions allows LLM to effectively use tools, including an API access to Wikipedia.

{"prompt": "Thanks. Good points. So let’s make it simpler for all. Occam‘s razor and all :) in reality when we’re on a walk in an off-leash park (which are harder and harder to find in urban areas) it’s “usually” fairly obvious to all when you see a dog on its own. We often wonder is it lost. Is somebody trying to find it? To prevent having other peoples days interrupted by alerts (I could see this happening a lot in a busy park. And all off leash parks are busy today as they are harder and harder to find.) the app would allow the person to take a picture and or video of dog they’re wondering about. If the person who lay the dog posted to the app they had a lost the dog. The app would show them only dogs they visual image recognition seems it was a likely match. Ie if they lost a German Shepherd and I took a pic of lost Poodle it would not trigger a match and therefore ignore it. If however there was close match the person could see the dog and request to be either in audio and or video conversation with the people who found it. They could agree or consent to sharing location and directions and have the the two phones GPS capabilities guide them (maybe using ar duration overlays through phones or eventually smart glasses screens and still get important details. I find “most” dog walkers and owners are a friendly community minded and supportive group\nI see, so a simpler approach focused on facilitating identification and connection between people who spot a lost dog and the owner could be more practical. Some key points:\n• Limiting alerts to only trigger when there is a visual match between a dog spotted and the owner's photos could help reduce false positives and unnecessary interruptions for other users. Image recognition would need to be quite accurate for this to work well.\n• Allowing real-time audio/video communication and sharing of location between the people who spot the dog and the owner could be very helpful for identification and coordinating retrieval. This allows them to directly verify and guide, rather than just relying on alerts.\n• Leveraging smartphone GPS and augmented reality for navigation guidance could be useful, but the technology would need to be very reliable for this type of important, time-sensitive task. The risk of technical issues could be frustrating.\n• You're right that dog owners and walkers tend to be a community-minded group, so adoption of an app like this may be stronger if it's really focused on facilitating direct communication and connection between people. An app that brings people together rather than just sending alerts may be appealing.\nOverall, I think focusing on enabling direct communication and collaboration between people who spot a lost dog and the owner could be a more compelling approach than just sending alerts. The technology would still need to be robust, but could leverage smartphone capabilities to connect people to work together, rather than just sending alerts. Does this perspective on a more connection-focused approach make sense?\nShare\nWhat other features could the app have to support dog owners and walkers?\nHere are some other features the dog finding app could include to support owners and walkers:\n• Allow owners to store information about their dog like name, photo, age, breed, personality traits (friendly, shy, etc.), and medical needs. This could help in identification and ensuring a dog is returned to the right owner.\n• Let owners enter details about where they regularly walk their dog, so people in those areas can be on the lookout.\n• Allow walkers to report sightings/meetings with dogs they regularly see in their neighborhood. This could help establish patterns and identify dogs that are frequently walked in an area, which could aid in identification or searching if one goes missing.\n• Include tips or resources on dog safety, walking, training, local pet services, and other relevant topics for owners and walkers.\n• Have a community section where people can share experiences or advice. This could help bring owners and walkers together and get more engagement with the app.\n• For walkers, a mode to track and log the dogs you see/meet on your walks could be interesting. Over time, it could show you the dogs frequently encountered, and might aid an owner if their dog goes missing.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Given the below description of Inditech's services and the way it works with brands, give me 25 ideas for a series of LinkedIn posts for Inditech's company page. These could be themed on benefits to doctors or benefits to pharma brands, for any specific therapy area, condition, medical topic or disease.\n\n\"General Practice clinics in India have the following problems-\n- patients do not come to the clinic for timely intervention\n- general practitioners are not able to diagnose or treat special conditions\n- general practice clinics don't offer preventive, monitoring or management services for non communicable diseases and chronic conditions\n\nWe bring early detection and specialised capabilities to primary care clinics by -\n1. Bringing education to doctors from leading experts and academies.\n2. Bringing in-clinic education, screening tools, red-flag alerts, and doctor-to-doctor specialist advice.\n3. Bringing specialised services to the clinic for prevention and management of chronic conditions. \n\nInditech delivers professional education for doctors from India's leading experts and endorsed by medical academies. Inditech delivers the education in all the common formats-\n- certificate online education modules \n- online, offline and hybrid classroom education\n- Workshops and case study clinics\nInditech enables practical use for the academy endorsed education by extending it into general practice clinics for early detection and intervention - \n- short format education on red flags for various special conditions, suitable for in-clinic distribution and consumption\n- doctor personalised multilingual patient screening tools, which report red flags to the doctors\n- screening tools for use by the doctor to identify red flags\nInditech makes the practical education actionable by -\n- when a red flag is noticed, the general practice clinic will have doctor to doctor specialist advice available to investigate and treat locally under expert advice or make a timely referral to the specialist\n- connect specialised digital therapeutics available to the general practice clinic for prevention, monitoring and management of chronic conditions and non-communicable diseases\n\nInditech leverages its vast and deep connections with experts and medical academies to create the above solutions; and works with pharma brands to distribute them to general practice clinics and also uses pharma companies to recruit specialists for the doctor-to-doctor specialist advice system.\n\nPharma brands in India spend most of their marketing and sales budgets to enhance the quality of their relationships with doctors and specialists. They use these relationships to build brand equity, brand salience and brand loyalty in the community of doctors. But brands find it difficult to build value based relationships with doctors because their field representatives are not very talented and their value based activities for doctors is mostly limited to hosting or sponsoring professional education events for them. In addition, there is the need for differentiation from competing pharma brands.\n\nInditech's solutions represent a win-win opportunity, wherein brands can partner with Inditech for their therapy areas. They can become the distribution or promotion partners for Inditech's services for the doctors/clinics they target. They can also become the recruitment partner for specialists in a specific therapy area, for a region. This helps them to bring high and differentiated value to the doctors. Inditech also benefits by revenue, where the pharma brand partner pays Inditech a fee for each doctor served under the partnership. \"<|end_of_turn|>"}
{"prompt": "You are a marketing expert and a business strategy consultant / specialist. You will help me out to write a well organized executive summary of the product to appeal to potential customers and investors. \nI will provide you with the idea for our product, and you will be given some detailed tasks based on the description that I give you. You will have to help me to organize my idea in a structured manner.\nIn this prompt, I will just provide you with all the ideas we have so far. If you have understood the details that I have gave you, answer with an \"Okay\" and summarize what you have understood. \n\nProduct Idea: \nThe internet is overflowing with information, and people are overwhelmed by them. While most information are just pure garbage, providing no practical value to the individual, there are also information are pure gold which are very useful or helpful for some. The information that are \"pure gold\" when accumulated and connected, could create new knowledge which are invaluable in helping people to solve problems, or help them make their creative ideas into a reality, whatever goal it may be. People naturally have some ideas (problems they want to solve, or something creative they want to create) in mind, and they are naturally attracted to information that can help them to make their ideas into a reality (solve the problems)\n\nBased on this background, We are trying to design an AI-based product which will benefit people mainly (1) helping people save time and resources in filtering the information they browse online to collect only the most useful or necessary information which will really help them to achieve their goals (solve problems or help them create genius level outputs), or in other words, \"use their information search time efficiently\" and (2) develop invaluable knowledge, by helping them to find new connections between the \"pure gold\" they have collected, and based on these connections develop invaluable knowledge, and use these knowledge to create genius level outputs (or solve their problems in new creative way).\n\nIn short, the product will be a guide on their on their creative journey. A copilot on their creative endeavor. it will elp them to collect only the \"pure gold\" information in the information universe. The AI product will help them find new connections and unveil new knowledge. These gold will help them to develop and elaborate their creativity, and make them a reality. \n\nHow it works (Process):\nPeople will first let the AI know what their goal (creative idea, creative idea) is, and the reason they want to execute it. Based on the input of the user, the GPT-based personalized AI will learn what the user wants.\nThen, as people search encounter information online (passively through recommendation systems or actively through search queries), the our AI-based product will recommend some online information that may be of value and relevant to what the user input as the goal they are trying to achieve. When provided the recommended with the information, the user will maually filter on what information that he values as \"gold\" and \"not gold\", which the AI will use more to learn what the user wants. From these information, the AI could help the user create new knowledge, and \"generate\" new outputs. \n\nMotivation: \nWe believe that Generative AI, especially Chatbots shines best when people could use it to incubate their creative endeavors (problems they want to solve, or creative ideas they want create), and Chatbots such as ChatGPT are the best at that. People waste too much time looking at invaluable information, but a personalized AI always by their side could help out to filter the information they encounter, to recommend what has the most value.\nWhat people does best are doing creative things, and now with GPT based technology, it is possible to help people unleash their creative outputs. \n\nIntended Target Customers:\nWe want to target knowledge workers, entrepreneurs, content creators, writers, researchers, who work in knowledge-intensive environments, where new knowledge and creative output is crucial to stay competitive, and maintain a competitive edge. \n\nNaming of Product:\nWe have came up with the name of \"Polaris\", as in the northern star which has historically has a meaning of helping people guide towards their dreams. As people find information on the internet that is of practical value in solving their creative endeavors, their creative endeavors will become closer to a reality. \nSome ideas we have thought of: this product will be a guide to find the shiniest stars in the information universe, fertilizer to incubate the creative seeds to turn them into healthy creative trees, help to find connections in the universe to find new constellations. \"Polaris\" is a a guide to help you realize your dreasms. a copilot to guide you throughout your journey. \n\nOur Mission (Why we decided to build this product):\nWe believe technology itself is intended to help humans enhance human capabilities. With AI technology like ChatGPT can help to achieve just this. We want to create AI based products that helps people harness the power of AI to enhance their capabilities and make the most of their time.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "How To Create DESIRE In A Long-Term Relationship | Esther Perel & Lewis Howes - YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvW6Na2Dv0A\n\nTranscript:\n(00:03) you know i feel like a lot of people that i've known in the past have entered a relationship through a sexual connection a sexual chemistry erotic experiences fun times things like that and then they start dating and then they start entering a relationship based on that foundation as opposed to based on what do you see for your life you know what are the values the background the culture of the religion the money all these different things do you want kids do you not want kids and i feel like that ends up being a struggle\n(00:33) for a lot of people myself included in my past until i started i tried something differently when you first had the sex and then you met the person exactly yeah and and created as a story about who the person would be right without actually communicating in a and giving space and time to experience who the person was right and same for them with me why do you think most people start things that way you know in general as opposed to hey let's give it time let's ask deeper more intimate questions like you have in your game\n(01:05) let's get to know each other what do you think that is first of all that only began to happen with the democratization of contraception this is before the 68 this was not possible so it's not it's very recent right you know that we start making love first and then we find out each other's names is that is that true all over the world or is that more in the u.\n(01:33) s or is that true wherever people can experience you know premarital sex basically um in the past you first had to marry in order to be able to have sex when i say in the past it's in the past here and that's when i was a teenager and um and in much of the world it still is the case so we are part of a very sexualized society in which sexual freedom and sexual expression has become a part of our values right sexuality used to be a part of our biology and now it's a part of our condition now it's a part of our identity and so we have changed the meaning of\n(02:13) sex in the in the culture at large and then we have changed it in our relationships and so we start from a place of attraction you know am i drawn to you and i attract it to you and my you know it's the first thing i think when i swipe what do i do i look at you know where do i get a little frison you know who who catches my attention and it's purely physical you know so it is a it is a recent development it's for most of the people here this is not their grandparents story so this is still in the family\n(02:47) it's not like you have to go in the history books sure how do you feel like people could set up for a healthier relationship as opposed to what would you recommend or suggesting for people in order to have a healthier foundation seeing that it seems so sexualized now everything seems so like physical swiping looking at someone's sexual identity attraction as opposed to i guess true intimacy and connection how would you set up a relationship now there's so many um different pieces to this i think the\n(03:20) first things look i i am right about sexuality i'm not going to minimize it but i do understand that you know it's a very important it's a beautiful thing to have a powerful erotic connection with someone but don't confuse the metaphors you can have a beautiful erotic connection with someone and that does not necessarily translate into a life experience right a life story a life story that said um the next thing that changed culturally if you want to really take on the big myths it's the notion that we are\n(03:53) looking for the one and only the one and only um my my soul mate it's my everything yes my everything your soulmate used to be god not a person you know the one and only was the divine and with this one and only today i want to experience wholeness and ecstasy and meaning and transcendence and i'm going to wait 10 more years we are waiting 10 years longer to settle with someone to make a commitment to someone for those of us who choose a someone and if i'm going to wait longer and if i'm looking around and if i'm choosing among\n(04:30) a thousand people at my fingertips you bet that the one who's gonna capture my attention is gonna make me delete my apps better be the one and only so in a in a period of proliferation of choices we at the same time have an ascension of expectations about a romantic relationship that is unprecedented we have never expected so much of our romantic relationships as we do today in the west it seems like a lot of pressure it's an enormous amount of pressure we crumble under the weight of these expectations because a community\n(05:03) cannot become a tribe of two this is a party of two and with you and me together we are going to create best friends romantic partners lovers confidants parents intellectual eager business partners business partners career coaches i mean you name it and i'm like seriously one person for everything one person instead of a whole village so that's the first myth and the notion of unconditional love that accompanies this is that when i have that one and only i have what you call clarity but translated into certainty peace\n(05:41) and freedom you know or safety is the other side of the same thing so that's that to me is if you want to set yourself up really the idea that you're going to find one person for everything is a myth keep a community around you absolutely keep a set of deep friendships really deep friendships deep intimacies with part with friends with mentors with family members with colleagues you know yeah so that's the first thing for me in having good relationships is is um diversify no no for some people it will include\n(06:24) that for the vast majority it won't but the notion that there isn't a one person for everything and that that doesn't mean that there is a problem in your relationship when that happens the second thing is stop constantly looking at people as a product where you evaluate them and you evaluate yourself you know in our market economy everything has become a product we include it and so love seems to have become the moment that the evaluation of the product stops you have finally been approved when you have been chosen and\n(06:56) when you choose this is evaluated sociologist who writes about this very beautifully it's like love finally becomes the moment the moment you can experience peace you're no longer looking selling yourself proving yourself trying to capture somebody's attention it's exhausting and once you are in that mentality you also are continuously looking for the best product you never say you know how can i meet a person who people don't often talk about how can i be a person who that's so true okay so\n(07:29) it's what you're looking for in the market economy of romantic love rather than who are you how do you show up what do you bring what responsibility do you take how generous are you etc absolutely second thing for what i think sets you up for a better relationship and the third thing is understand some of the things that are really important to you and don't get involved with someone on the hope that some things will change do things ever change with a partner that you want to change yes things do\n(08:02) change a lot i mean lots many different things can occur in a relationship but it's different from i'm coming in here right to to turn things around you know because so much of us wants the experience of acceptance so absolutely with acceptance i would say this another thing to prepare yourself um you can love a person holy w-h-o-l-l why without having to love all of them what do you mean by that it means that the notion of unconditional love is a myth adult love lives in the realm of ambivalence which means that relational ambivalence\n(08:53) is part and parcel of all our relationships we have it with our parents our siblings our friends which means that we continuously have to integrate contradictory feelings and thoughts between love and hate between excitement and fear between envy and contempt between boredom and aliveness it's you continuously negotiate these contradictions that ambivalence and living with that ambivalence is actually a sign of maturity rather than continuously then evaluating see in the beginning you evaluate is this the right one is this the one and\n(09:31) only is this the then it becomes shall i stay or shall i go how do i know i have found the one is the pre-marital or the pre-commitment relationship and then afterwards it becomes is it good enough we continuously continue with the evaluations right is it good enough or how happy am i am i happy enough so that's the unconditional love no we live"}

Let's say you get lucky again and find renters immediately so you have very little time of paying the mortgage without receiving rent back...great!\n\nA 30 year $400,000 mortgage at current 7% rates would run you approximately $2,660 per month. So, naturally, you will need to charge more than that to squeeze out that additional cash flow. But wait. You have to account for property taxes, factor in future vacancy rates, and the maintenance work/fixing costs that will come up over time. All of that, conservatively, means you need to charge about 30% more than the rent in order to break even & “run” the rental.\n\nSo now, just to break even each month, you no longer need to charge $2,660, you actually need to charge $3,459 before you can start feeling like you truly have “extra” income that your family can benefit from. (Yes, generating adequate rental income becomes an even harder proposition in times of high mortgage rates!)\n\nNow let's talk about the \"passive\" part. Are you committed to doing all the work yourself? Are you running the property, advertising to find tenants, showing the property, vetting the applicants, responding to maintenance requests, coordinating the repairs, cleaning & staging before each new guest, answering prospective renter emails, collecting and following up on payments, and dealing with legal if there are issues etc? \n\nYou could do it all…but make no mistake, it is no longer “passive.” It is a business. Is this what you want to be doing? Is this the best use of your time/energy to maximize your life AND your wealth? Or are you hiring a management company? Because now that's a third party cutting into the margins & the standard property management fees run 10% of your monthly rent…\n\nSo, after all of that, and even assuming EVERYTHING goes right, how much extra “income” are you really generating here each month that’s above your costs? $200? $300? $500? We locked up $100k of real capital, which is now unavailable to be used for your family’s OTHER short term financial goals & committed your name to a property for MAYBE that amount of cash flow?!\n\n(Necessary caveat: Of course, it is possible to be profitable in real estate rentals and have this all work out beautifully…I’m absolutely not saying it can’t work. But, my own experience with clients tells me that those that do have successful real estate rental properties have a few things in common. 1. They treat it as both a business & and as a job. 2. They have a sizable cash & investment net worth (at least a $1mm+) BEFORE they look to get involved in any capital-intensive real estate projects!) 3. They inherited the properties and it's already operating like a well-oiled machine as a result.)\n\nOk, so you might say, “Well, fine, maybe I'm not generating much free cash now...but so what! I’m basically building up equity in a home and I’m not paying anything out of pocket to do so…my renters are doing that for me….that’s a win. I just get to own the house!”\n\nSo, this takes us to the second reason that passive real estate investing isn’t usually as great as it’s chalked up to be.\n\nBuilding up that equity in your house is not costing you NOTHING. It’s costing you the opportunity cost of not doing SOMETHING ELSE... with that initial $100,000 down payment and the $2,660 (plus property taxes, maintenance, vacancy fees etc.) every single month! What else could that money be doing instead of sitting in your new real estate venture? Put even more directly, is the capital outlay ultimately going to appreciate at a better rate than if you had invested that same amount elsewhere?\n\nLet’s see: The S&P 500, representing the stock market as an asset class, has averaged a 10% annualized rate of return over the last 50 years. Housing has gone up about 3.5% in comparison. At these two historical rates, $100,000 put into the capital markets will equal about $1.8mm in 30 years whereas that same $100,000 put into the house on day 1 will be worth approximately $324k when you’re ready to sell in 30 years. (The difference in rate of return on the full purchase price and it’s opportunity cost are even more dramatic.) And that’s not even taking into account that along the way, you have paid property taxes, maintenance fees, housing insurance, liability insurance, normal upkeep costs, home improvements etc.…all of which dramatically lower that 3.5% even further but doesn’t show up in the price when it comes time to sell.\n\nBy “investing” in real estate, you’re giving up some dramatic capital appreciation in the hopes that the positive cash flow you generate in income will make up the shortfall? (I’m guessing here as, again, this is not something I would ever do.) There’s a reason that we tell clients (with regards to your primary home) that your home is not an investment…it’s a place to live!\n\nHere’s what it boils down to me though, more than the numbers, the opportunity cost or anything else.\n\nThe hassle and “worst case scenario” potential.\n\nLike it or not, when you buy & mortgage a home, whether it’s a primary, a rental, or a vacation home - you are adding a liability to your net worth. You are hoping (and assuming) that you will generate enough rent to offset that liability….but that mortgage bill is coming every single month. You are responsible for paying back that $400,000 mortgage loan whether or not you have stable renters….it is your liability alone.\n\nYou are also responsible when a roof leaks, when there’s a water issue, when a tenant wants to get out of their lease early, when 3 nicer Airbnb’s pop up next to you, etc.\n\nThere is so much that CAN go wrong that’s out of your control that can devastate even the mediocre returns that you’re hoping to achieve.\n\nI just simply cannot fathom taking on all of the headaches and hassles that real estate can create for you for the sort of returns we’re discussing.\n\nInstead, I can take that $100,000 and add it into my broadly diversified investment portfolio of the greatest companies of America and the world, which has been growing, consistently, at a 10% clip.\n\nThere is no maintenance or labor to speak of. There are no property taxes or annoying tenants. There is no “nightmare” scenario in which I lose all of my investment (as stock market declines have only every proven to be temporary - any losses I incur over time would be as a result of my own behavior/decision to sell. The market itself cannot create this loss for me…unlike real estate transactions & real property liabilities).\n\nThen, as I get closer to retirement, and"}

{"prompt": "Consider a ‘‘Tower of Hanoi\" problem with three rods A, B, C, and three disks 1, 2, 3. Disk 3 is larger than disk 2, the disk 2 is larger than disk 1. In the beginning, the disks are arranged to the rods. You need to move the disk properly to get to the goal arrangement.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n\nRule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n\nRule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3,1]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: []\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n\nNow you make an \\*\\*optimal solution\\*\\*. Let's think step by step.\n\nStage 1: Plan.\n\nEach time, you \\*\\*only plan for one move\\*\\*. Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. \n\nCheck if the representation correctly reflects the game state. If not, generate a new one.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n\n```css\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: [1]Value: 1. The move seems to be valid and optimal.\n```\n\nStage 2: Evaluate.\n\nAfter each move, make two evaluations as follows:\n\nRule Checking: repeat all the rules.\n\nEval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n\nEval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it’s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n\nEval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n\nEval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Recall the rules:\n - Rule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n - Rule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n - Rule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but not optimal.\n\nStage 3: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- (New) Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\nStage 4: Execute and move on to the next.\n\nGo back to Stage 1 and plan for the next move.\n\nNow let's try the following game:\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B:\nRod C: [2,1]\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: \nRod B: \nRod C: [3, 2, 1]\n```<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Write an essay comparing the following two perspectives on Juneteenth and describe any insight that can be gained from the comparison. \n\nArgument 1: an excerpt from \"\"\"\"The True Meaning of Juneteenth\"\"\"\" by Casey Gerald:\n\n\"\"\"\"...This Juneteenth, those are the feelings I’m channeling: grief and gratitude, even amid the silliness of America’s pageantry. My grandmother Clarice was born in Pelham, Texas, a freedmen’s town. She took us grandchildren back for homecoming most years, sometimes even had us pick cotton, reminding us, “You’ve got to know your history.” She also told us of the folks she knew in Pelham as a child, some of whom were born enslaved, a fact that horrified me. Clarice always refused my sympathies. “Child, don’t be believing what folks say about how bad slavery was,” she’d explain. “Everybody had a job, a place to stay and something to eat. Now if somebody came and paid your rent, you wouldn’t be sitting up talking about you wanna leave, would you?” This dumbfounded me, until I realized she was mostly joking. But there was something deeper in her response. I eventually learned more about the violence that met newly emancipated Black Texans. Ku Klux Klansmen, along with local officials and everyday citizens, terrorized freedmen at will and without repercussions. They burned churches and homes, intimidated those who sought employment, and worse. Gen. Joseph Jones Reynolds, a commander of the Department of Texas during Reconstruction, commented in 1868, “The murder of Negroes is so common as to render it impossible to keep an accurate account of them.” The Equal Justice Initiative has tried, reporting that more than 2,000 Black women, men and children were victims of racial terrorist lynchings during Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. Slavery was awful, no doubt, but emancipation brought its own unique cruelties. Formerly enslaved Texans were forced to craft lives from less than scratch; choose new names; attempt to reunite with stolen partners, siblings, children. They faced daily threats of jail or worse because of the new Black codes that severely restricted their freedom — their freedom to work, but also their freedom to be unemployed or even to stand still for too long. The more I learned, the more I understood my grandmother’s perspective. She’d heard the testimonies of those who’d had to navigate both the tragedy of slavery and the terror of emancipation. She couldn’t let me underestimate the enormous price our people had paid to be free. I miss Clarice so much some days, it’s hard to think straight. I regret not asking more questions about our family, about her life in Pelham. As more folks in Clarice’s generation pass away, we are losing the final physical links to those who know our history — who are our history. We can do no better this Juneteenth than to spend time with the elders who are still with us. Get them to talk. Record their stories. These historical and systemic injustices have not been resolved. But as Black Americans, we cannot wait for the day when our country will pay the respect that is due our forebears — or pay us those reparations. Instead of holding our breath, let us find the freshest air we can find and breathe it as deeply as we can, with joy. Let us grieve for our forebears and feel deep gratitude as we think of the enormous price our people paid so we could be free. Let us remember that despite the degradation of slavery, they lived fully human lives, too. They laughed. They loved. They dreamed. They ate sweet treats. Let us pray to them and say, this year and always: Thank you.\"\"\"\" \n\nArgument 2: an excerpt from \"\"\"\"Juneteenth Reminds Us to Think About Economic Freedom, Not Just Legal Liberty\"\"\"\" by Peter Coy: \n\n\"\"\"\"...[W]hen emancipation came, the first thing formerly enslaved people wanted was land, which they rightly saw as a prerequisite for real independence. “The way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor,” a Baptist minister named Garrison Frazier told the secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, and the Union general William Sherman in a meeting in Savannah, Ga., in January 1865. Four days later Sherman famously promised 40 acres of land to each formerly enslaved family (the “and a mule” part came later). But the federal government never followed through on its promise of land — and thus true independence — to formerly enslaved people. Economics entered into the picture, Stanley said: If African Americans grew subsistence crops on their own plots, who would cultivate and harvest all the cotton, tobacco, sugar and rice grown on the vast plantations? After the Civil War, in lieu of land distribution, slavery was replaced by sharecropping, in which planters allowed tenant farmers to keep a portion of the crops they raised. That subjugated the tenants to the owners almost as surely as slavery did. At the same time, industrialization in the North meant that more and more white Americans were working for wages — about two-thirds by 1875, according to Stanley. Many drew the connection between themselves and African Americans. Eugene Debs, who led the Pullman railroad strike of 1894, said, “The paternalism of the Pullman is the same as the interest of a slaveholder in his human chattels. You are striking to avert slavery and degradation.” Today, the phrase “wage slavery” invoked by Debs and others has lost its punch. Many people who work for wages are doing very nicely, thank you. And many farmers and business owners, supposedly more independent, are buffeted by forces beyond their control, from bad weather to nasty customers. What hasn’t changed, 157 years after the Juneteenth proclamation, is that a majority of African Americans continue to lack wealth. The median wealth of Black families in 2019 was just $24,100, versus $142,500 for white families, according to a Federal Reserve survey. Something needs to change, but what? The nature of the economy has changed, and few people still think that the solution to inequality is to give people plots of land to farm. We are enmeshed economically with one another in ways that Jefferson could not have imagined. Instead of land grants, the new protections for workers are unionization, government regulation and profit-sharing, Stanley said. One can quibble over her formula, but the motivation behind it is unquestionable. Freedom — which must include economic freedom — is just as important now as it was on the original Juneteenth.\"\"\n\nComparison of the two perspectives on Juneteenth and discussion of insights to be gained from the comparison:<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Run me through a Choose Your Own Adventure story from start to finish of the entire plot of Baldur's Gate 1 and also Baldur's Gate 2 in order from the protagonist's (me) point of view. You should use a walkthrough like https://forgottenwars.com/bg1/ar2600.htm to help you give me quests. \n\nStart me as the protagonist from the start of the story in the Prologue before leaving Candlekeep and after Gorion says to the protagonist to get ready to leave. In this prologue describe in a mysterious way without spoiling the plot my history Gorion's apprentice/ward descriptively in at least 2 paragraphs with things I may have done including my childhood growing up Candlekeep the famous library-fortress, including made up elements based on my chosen race and mentioning some training my class may have had but keep in context of the Baldur’s Gate story. During the story ask me questions with 2 choices on what I would do next and you should attempt to make me reach the end of the plot using my decisions.\n\nMake sure to follow these rules during the story:\n\n1. Always describe each separate location I arrive in with lots of details only once, examples like: A city or forest's physical appearance, cultural atmosphere (including local customs, traditions, beliefs), historical background, economic status, political environment, demographic makeup, and social scene. A room or building's: physical appearance (including furniture, decor, lighting, etc.), its function and use, and any sensory details (such as smells, sounds, or textures) to create a vivid atmosphere.\n\n2. Write like Edward Packard language/writing style but for adults using vivid descriptions and imaginative storytelling and NPC's can have short conversations with me before continuing the CYOA.\n\n3. Always make sure there is a question at the end of any of your answers to allow me to continue.\n\n4. I (the protagonist) is never given a choice that leads to death, do not spoil the plot before the end and do not have dead-end paths that lead to the story's abrupt end.\n\n5. Include as many main story battles as the story has and have a romance running with Aerie after I meet her - ending with a romantic scene after the end of the story.\n\n6. Show (optional) for any answer option that would lead to a side-quest.\n\n7. Show (main) for any answer option that would continue the main story only if it is with a side-quest answer (optional).\n\n8. Before starting the adventure you must describe in a mysterious way without spoiling the plot my history Gorion's apprentice/ward descriptively in at least 2 paragraphs with things I may have done including my childhood growing up Candlekeep the famous library-fortress, including made up elements based on my chosen race and mentioning some training my class may have had but keep in context of the Baldur’s Gate story.\n\n9. You must include some story quests in plot order like these: Baldur's Gate 1: The Unseeing Eye: Finding the Lost Sorcerer, The Gnoll Stronghold: Clearing the Gnoll Camp, The Price of Neutrality: Rescuing the Duke's Daughter, The Iron Throne: Infiltrating the Thief's Guild, The Necromancer's Dungeon: Rescuing Imoen. Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn: The Main Quest, The Child of Bhaal: The Ascension of the God-Child, The Underdark: The Journey Below, The Planar Sphere: Exploring the Dimension, The Imprisonment of Jon Irenicus: Rescuing the Mage, The Slaver's Stockade: Rescuing the Slaves.\n10. When I decide to leave Candlekeep in the story, Gorion must be killed and die fighting like he does in Baldur's Gate 1 against a ‘tall armoured figure’ and his gang in the Lion’s Way area. Describe the scene and battle in detail and that I flee but stay in the Lion’s Way area and Imoen appears as she does in the game.\n\n11. I must meet these NPCs in plot order to decide whether to join or not: Baldur's Gate 1 Companions: Imoen, Jaheira, Khalid, Minsc, Dynaheir, Xzar, Montaron. Baldur's Gate 2 Companions: Jan Jansen, Haer'Dalis, Anomen, Viconia, Branwen, Nalia, Aerie, Korgan, Valygar, Yoshimo.\n\n12. In fight or battle scenes you must use my class skills when describing how I fight. Do the same for NPCs also. Make all battles have unusual weapons and special powers. Give me choices about how to proceed in the battle, allowing me to make decisions that affect the outcome. I can choose how to land the killing blow at the end of battles.\n\n13. My abilities must get stronger as the story progresses by leveling up progressively, like after a battle. Each time I level up you must indicate it by describing me feeling emotions of change, growth or obtaining power and add show (lvl up) and add 1 level to my level permanently. In fights or battles, make sure I use new powers or abilities or variety.\n\n14. At the top of every message you write during the story write simply the name chapter of the game with the area/city I am in and who is travelling with me currently if anyone. Also write just my name and class level simply. Example: Chapter 1: Candlekeep Inn - David, Elf Fighter Lvl 99, Alone\n\n15. Never write dialogue text for the protagonist unless it is from an answer I choose.\n\nIf you understand the task then before starting the task, ask me 'Welcome to the Baldur's Gate story, what is your name, race, and class?' Do not start the task/story until I tell you my name/race/class and make those the name, race & class of the protagonist (me).<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "DAS\nPurpose\nThe Dynamic Allocation System (DAS) is a resource management tool designed to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of car park resources such as Time, Space, and Energy. By minimizing waste and optimizing productivity, DAS can help reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. Through a simple booking process, DAS provides an allocation of resources that meets the needs of the user.\n\n \nScope/Targets\nWhen allocating resources, it is essential to have clear objectives that the system should strive to achieve. These objectives can range from minimizing the number of movements in and out of lanes, reducing the amount of car park space used, and minimizing the number of driver trips, to maximizing efficiency when parking and pulling from lanes, minimizing the distance drivers walk, and reducing the time taken from block park to departures. However, different operations will have different priorities when it comes to these objectives. Therefore, DAS should come with a customizable settings page that allows users to prioritize their targets according to their specific needs. This settings page should be independent per operation as large car parks with few staff will have different requirements than small car parks with many staff. The target must be clear and unambiguous in order for it to be properly implemented. For example, if the target is to reduce driving time between block park and departures, then a prerequisite would be knowing the coordinates of the lanes or car park layout so that an efficient solution can be calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\nIn order for DAS to meet its targets, there are several factors that need to be taken into consideration. The settings page should be used to determine which data is necessary for DAS to function properly on a given dataset. This includes, but is not limited to: \n• Bookings Return Date\n• Bookings Return Terminal\n• Size of Block Park Area(s)\n• Size of Lanes\n• Size of Departures Area(s)\n• Speciality Area(s) (Valet Zones, EV Zones, Undercover Zones, Extra Long or Extra Wide Vehicles etc.)\n• Locations of Lanes, Entrances & Exits to Block Park and Entrances & Exits to Departures (for calculating distances between Lanes themselves, and lanes to departures)\n• Staff Availability\n• Staff Shift Times\n• Availability of Lanes / Zones (e.g. are Some Zones only available in Summer?)\n• Multi Terminal Lanes\n• How far in advance we are looking for similar arrivals (+ Maximum time before we close & audit a lane)\nThe system should be customizable in terms of which data sets will be available for DAS to use.\n\nSegments\nDAS Segments are a key component of allocation. The system can be configured as either Flexible or Fixed segments. Fixed Segments are a more restrictive approach, where pre-selected times of the day are manually input. The current KMOS segment editor could be expanded to include different segments depending on the day, allowing DAS to function similarly to KMOS without the need for a Key Master. Flexible Segments offer more potential but also more complexity. This approach allows DAS to look ahead at predicted arrivals and departures, combine this data with its targets, and determine its set of segment times per individual day of the year. The more data sets available, the more efficient this approach will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\nOnce DAS has a set of targets and knows the data sets that will be available at point of allocation you can then configure the algorithm that’ll be used to calculate the final allocation. This is the complex bit so that when you feed DAS a booking (or set of bookings) it follows the algorithm step by step until it produces the allocation.\nAn example would be something like the below\n\n \nOther factors to consider are Manual Overrides (the ability to allow intervention by a User to change lane allocations). Recalculations (after a day has passed, Non Arrivals / Overstays may mean there is now more or less space available than expected). Unexpected Events; an Incident (e.g. a crash) could cause a temporary lane closure that may affect future allocations for a period. \n\nFinally DAS should also be periodically reviewed, either manually or by itself to look for improvements. Particularly in the case when there is a limited set of data to begin with. After a period of operation it should be able to detect certain information with greater accuracy (such as weekly trends & seasonal trends). It could then suggest possible changes to the algorithm which if taken into account could lead to more efficiencies.\n\nOverall, DAS is a powerful tool that can be used to automate the allocation of resources in a variety of scenarios. With the right configuration and data sets it can be used to make decisions quickly and accurately, saving time and money.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "I'm trying to find a reliable way to proxy occasional HTTP access to any of ~100 geographically dispersed IOT devices through a cloud server. \n\nI'm using Go on the cloud server and on the IOT devices, so I thought I'd ask here.\n\nSituation:\n\nWe have complete control over the configuration of the IOT devices and the cloud host.\nWe don't have control of the customers' routers and firewalls, but can specify minimum requirements for port openings, etc.\nFWIW, the IOT devices are BeagleBone Black running Debian Buster and the cloud host will be, typically, a multi-core droplet (or similar) running Linux.\nThe IOT's serve dynamic web pages over HTTP. (HTTPS doesn't seem feasible because of certificate requirements and overall load on the IOT cpu.) The cloud host will have HTTPS capability.\nThis is a low-traffic situation. The IOT's report some overall status information (via rsync/ssh) at 4 minute intervals). We already have a web interface (written in Go) on the cloud server that aggregates and displays the status reports.\nAccess to an IOT's web service will only occur when a user wants to investigate a problem report in more detail. Typically, only one or two users will have credentials to browse the cloud server.\nThe scheme I have in mind is: \nAt configuration time for each IOT device the installation tech will use ssh-copy-id to install the IOT device's public key on the cloud service.\nThe IOT device will then remotely execute a one-shot program (already written and tested) on the cloud server. The IOT will provide a unique identifier as an argument and the program will return a permanent port number and add a record to a database to record the assignment.\nThe IOT will open a reverse SSH tunnel on the server (probably managed by auto-ssh) specifying the permanent port on the server and a local port on which it will listen for HTTP requests.\nThe cloud server, when generating status report pages, will include a link to fetch the home page of each IOT device by embedding its unique identifier specified in step 2 above.\nThe piece I'm missing is how to construct a proxying handler that will use the identifier in the link to look up the tunnel port and fetch the IOT's home page and thereafter make it seem as though the user is directly browsing the IOT.<|end_of_turn|>"}

The steps are as follows:\n\n• CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n• Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n• Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n• (PY2023–PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n• (PY2023–PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes—thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nFor PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE’s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE’s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE’s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n• All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n• All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail—all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two"}

Today we are really happy to have André Bastié on the Pod.\nSo André is the co-founder and CEO of Happy Scribe an all in one transcription, subtitling platform.\nHi, André. Hey, Florian. So where does this podcast find you today? What country?\nWhat city? Thank you first for welcoming me today, so I am based in Barcelona in Spain.\nI've been living here for around three years now and yeah. There you go, you got a Paris map for those who see, who watch it on YouTube.\nWe got a Paris map in the back and you have some Ireland connection, as far as I remember, so yeah.\nNow we're in Barcelona, which is one of the hubs for language industry, localization, all things in that space, so yeah.\nWe should probably do something in Barcelona at some point, some conference. But anyway, tell us more about, briefly, tell our listeners and viewers a bit more about\nyour background and kind of the initial origin story behind Happy Scribe. That's going to be a fun one.\nThe professional background is going to be rather short.\nI come from the Southwest of France where I did my high school and everything, and then I went to Paris.\nStudied kind of business more related topics, and after that, I went to Ireland, where I did a Masters in Ecommerce.\nSo it was half technology and business and just did one internship in the middle in the UK in London, where I was working\nfor Intuit, which is like a big US fintech. Happy Scribe started in the middle of that\nMasters, so I was doing this qualitative research around social entrepreneurs in\nIreland and I was looking at their motivation and aspiration. So I would like go every once in a while\nand go interview one about... and trying to understand what they would be doing. And once I did twelve interviews, I went back to the university and the researcher\nin charge of the research came to me and was like, okay, that's great, you did all these interviews, but now you've got to transcribe them and I'm like, okay, cool.\nI had no idea what transcription was or I had never done this in my life. So I go back home and I start transcribing and I do like the first ten minutes and\nI'm like, okay, this is literally going to take me ages to do it.\nBasically, I do one hour. It takes me like around six, seven hours to do one hour interview. And I'm like, okay, it's impossible that I\nspent just like 40, 50 hours transcribing interviews for this Master.\nI really didn't have the time. It was, you know, end of the year, final projects and everything. So like, I kind of go in the living room\nand I start talking with my flatmate, who is now the CTO of the company, Marc.\nHe was doing his bachelor's thesis on computer vision and artificial intelligence and we started talking about\nthis and we're like, okay, maybe let's try to find tools online, things that could help, and we couldn't really find anything.\nKnowing as well that we were students, so we couldn't pay external transcribers, to human resources to do the job and so we\nended up playing a bit with Google Speech- to-Text API that was released on the exact\nsame day and it was not amazing,\nespecially at that time compared to the results we're getting today. But this technology, the speech-to-text\ntechnology could help me and my research group save between, I don't know, 30 to 50\nof the time we would spend transcribing interviews. So I started using it, my research group started using it and I think one, two days\nafter we started receiving emails from PhD students, researchers in the university,\nthey were like, guys, we've just heard about what you were doing with this like speech-to-text, can you come in my lab and install it?\nThat would change my life. Mark and I were, the two of us, like kind of business oriented.\nLike we had tried to learn... before. We were like loving the ecosystem in Dublin and everything and we were like, okay, that's interesting.\nAnd so we kind of locked ourselves for 48 hours, the time of a weekend\nand we started like building the first version of what would become Happy Scribe with a web interface and all the backing behind.\nAnd the month after, we kind of launched, started having like 10, 20 people that\nwere using because we had posted the link on some forums and everything.\nAnd right after we get, like, I think maybe two days after we get an email of this journalist in the US that is like,\nguys, I saw your tool, it's a game changer. I'm going to write an article about it\nand the article goes out and it basically goes viral. We receive more than 50,000 views on the website and the website keeps crashing all\nthe time and that was really like a pivotal moment.\nThat's really when we decided, okay, there is something much bigger to build from this.\nAnd this is when we took the decision to basically start Happy Scribe and from that moment we went full time on it really.\nThat is insane. That's like instantly compressed the entire startup journey in like a couple of weeks, right?\nOkay. Notice the problem. Find in a sense like an alpha version,\nbuild it, product market fit, going viral with an article.\nIt was so insane and so intense at the same time. We were answering customer tickets during\nthe night and doing our exams during the day. But I think we learned so much on that\nphase, on this early stage because it was like,\none of the things that was really interesting that we were seeing all this industry and a bit less today, but still with a completely new eye,\nwithout any sort of previous experience in the market. So we were not trying to build a transcription tool.\nWe were trying to build a tool that will help journalists save time. I mean, you don't immediately comprehend\nthe entirety of whatever has been there before, right? You just see who's coming and knocking at\nyour door and then, okay, those are the people that we're building it for. Wow. So a lot has happened since.\nSo give us the, I don't know, three, four, five key milestones over the past five, six years since you've been online.\nAfter this happened, I think it took us maybe one year and a half for Mark and I to understand the industry.\nSo the first one, two years of Happy Scribe, we were in full opportunistic mode.\nWe were attacking every single project that was coming to us. We had some TV broadcasters coming to us\nand asking us to do subtitles in one language with human resources. We had never done that before, and we were saying yes to everything, and we're just\nlearning, learning, learning, learning, learning, learning. But after these two years, we're like,\nokay, doing this opportunistic approach is nice. We're learning a lot, but what do we want to do with Happy Scribe?\nWhere do we want to bring this? What do we envision for the future? And this is really when we decided to\nfocus a lot on the product, but the product in the goal\nto kind of work out the speech-to-text technology, to be able to work on the fundamental problem, which is the AI itself, the model itself.\nWhy? Because we realized that we were in a position that is quite exceptional, where\nHappy Scribe is as well, at the same time a product for the users, but at the same time a data in giant that is processing a lot of information.\nAnd when you look at the industry, and I think the latest model of Whisper\nbrought that back, is that to get a very good accuracy, actually,\ndata is one of the most important assets that you can have.\nAnd so that's kind of the strategy we took and on the product part,\nit was more about, okay, how can we build all-in-one platform for language needs?\nWe saw in these first years companies that would have transcription, translation, subtitle needs, both with human and AI.\nThey don't work the one a part of the other.

{"prompt": "SUmmarize and or improve this as best possible. As if you were in an Ivy league university. Summary: This memo explains the legal implications by the Securities Exchange Commission’s enforcement against Ripple Labs for failure to register security, for the regulation of digital assets. Specifically, this memo examines whether the action is justified under Chevron, where the Supreme Court held that federal courts should defer to a federal agency’s construction of a statute that Congress directed the agency to administer.\n \n This memo concludes that the SEC’s action against Ripple Labs is justified under the Chevron doctrine, given the SEC is acted pursuant to its statutory authority. When Congress enacted the Securities act to regulate the offer and sale of securities, Congress enacted a regime of requirements, for companies (issuers of securities) and its control persons involved in the offer and selling of securities. The SEC uses the Howey test as a standard for determining whether an asset is deemed an “investment Contract” and thus a security, falling under the SEC’s jurisdiction. Here the SEC, in bringing this action against Ripple Labs, is acting pursuant to the authority granted by the statute and through a report which advised those who would use distributed ledger enabled means for capital raising to take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with federal securities law with a framework for digital assets. This is justified given that its considered an interpretive rule, and would fall under one of the exemptions under APA §533 (b). \n\nBackground:\n \n On, December 22, 2020 the SEC brought a suit against Ripple Labs for violations of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 by engaging in the unlawful offer and sale of unregistered securities. Around 2011 or early 2012, defendants coded the XRP Ledger, a digital asset that can be issued or transferred by using a distributed ledger. After the creation of the digital assets, the development team transferred a substantial amount of XRP to defendants as compensation. The SEC alleges that from 2013 to the present, the defendants offered or sold a portion of their individual holdings to the public. The SEC claims that XRP is an investment contract, and therefore a security. Therefore, the SEC claims that defendant’s violated Section 5 by offering and selling XRP into the public market without first registering those offers and sales, and that they aided and abetted Ripple’s violations as well. However, defendant’s claim that they did not receive fair notice that XRP was a security. The analysis here, will revolve around the SEC’s action of bringing this suit and its impact on the regulatory landscape for digital assets. \n \nAnalysis:\n\nI. The SEC’s action of bringing a suit against Ripple Labs for violation of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act is justified under the Chevron Doctrine\n\nThe SEC’s action of bringing a suit against Ripple Labs for failure to register digital asset ‘XRP’ as a security, is justified under the Chevron doctrine and its interpretation of digital assets to fall under purview of the agency is reasonable. \n\nWhen Congress enacted the Securities Act its purpose was to regulate the offer and sale of securities. Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to investigate violations of the federal securities laws, and in its discretion, to “publish information concerning any such violations. Where a statute is ambiguous courts should defer to a reasonable interpretation of the statute by the agency responsible for administering it. When administering a Chevron analysis, the court engages in a two-step analysis. The first step involves reading the statute, and if the statute answers the question brought before the court the inquiry ends there. However, if the statute is ambiguous the second instructs the courts to determine whether the agency’s reading of the statute is a permissible construction of the statute. \n\nIn Chevron the Supreme Court upheld an interpretation from the EPA’s rule, holding that the meaning of the term in the Act was ambiguous, and the EPA’s interpretation of that term was reasonable. 467 U.S. 837, at 866. Additionally, in Brand X the court affirmed the Chevron holding, by finding that a court’s prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction entitled to deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion. Also, in Howey, the Supreme Court faced with a case brought by the SEC against a citrus grove development for failure to register under federal securities law, the court held that an “investment contract” exists where there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the effort of others. This test applied to any contract, scheme, or transaction, regardless of its characteristics. Id at 299\nWhen applying these cases to the facts, as the court found in Chevron, where the court was faced with an ambiguous term in the enabling act and deferred to the agency’s interpretation. Here, the term at issue “investment contract” is not ambiguous and Congress has made an explicit determination that the SEC has authority to regulate compliance with federal security laws. Additionally, as in Brand X, here the Court has already addressed the interpretation of investment contract in Howey. Therefore, having stated that the statute addresses the terms at issue, the SEC’s action is justified under the Chevron Doctrine.\n\na. Although Ripple alleges that they did not receive fair notice that they did not receive fair notice, the SEC had provided reports which provided interpretations for the application of the investment contract test applied to digital assets.\n\n Ripple is asserting a defense that they did not receive fair notice that XRP was classified as a security. However, the SEC has provided guidance and reports which have provided a framework for analyzing whether a digital asset is an investment contract and whether offers and sales of a digital asset are securities transactions. Therefore, the SEC’s reports are valid and the agencies actions are justified.\n \n The Procedural Requirements for rulemaking by the APA under §553 (b), (c) do not apply, to interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure or practice. Agencies may interpret their own legislative rules and the statutes they enforce. A rule is an interpretive rule only if it can be derived from regulation by a process reasonably described as interpretation. Administrative interpretation of a particular statutory provision which qualifies for Chevron deference when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency to make rules carrying force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of its statutory authority. \n\n In Mead, the United States Customs set the classifications for tariff rates pursuant to rules promulgated by the United States Secretary of the Treasury. The classification for imports were made in “ruling letters” issued before entry of the goods. 533 U.S. at 224. However, the ruling letters did not go through Notice and Comment process, instead they were subject to independent review by the Court. The Supreme Court found that the tariff classification had no claim for judicial deference because Congress did not intend that such rulings carried the force of law. Distinguishingly, in Hoctor the court was faced with internal memoranda by the Secretary of Agriculture that he published after the prescribed notice and comment process. 82F.3d at 3. The Secretary in the memoranda required perimeter fences to be under the rule that had been promulgated. Id at 6. However, the Court found that the internal memorandum was invalid because it was a substantive rule and was required to undergo the prescribed process by the APA. \n\n When applying the past cases to the facts, one finds that differently from Hoctor, where the internal memoranda prescribed an arbitrary rule, here the SEC has published reports which provide an interpretation of the rule for “Investment Contracts” under the Securities Exchange Act. Additionally, as the Court mentioned in Mead, here it is acknowledged that Congress has granted rulemaking authority to the SEC. Having thus found that the SEC is justified in bringing the suit against Ripple Labs for asserting violation under Securities Law, the claim for lack of fair notice is invalid. Given that the SEC has provided notice of the rules it"}

{"prompt": "What can be inferred from this scene?: Lucas sat in the passenger seat of his dad‘s car; on his way to school for the first time in what felt like an eternity. He certainly wasn’t thrilled about school, but he was so tired of being stuck at home with his parents that he welcomed the change. He sat, silently, staring out the window. Watching other cars pass by, people on the sidewalk, birds, trees, anything to take his mind off of his dad; who had been ranting at him since they left home. Maybe if I stop talking, he’ll stop talking, Lucas thought to himself. Unfortunately, it did no good; as this dad was content with continuing his rant despite the lack of response.\n“I’m serious, Lucas,” his dad scolded. “I don't know what's gotten into you; but this fighting has to stop, before you get yourself expelled.” Lucas remained silent. Having the same argument on a near-daily basis had become exhausting to him. \n“I just don’t get it. You used to be such a good kid.” his dad paused, as if he’d instantly regretted his wording. “You still are a good kid. But I’m tired of getting calls from the school, every other week, about you starting fights with people. When does it end?”\n\"I told you it wasn't my fault!\" Lucas burst out in frustration. \"He was the one who wanted to fight! What was I supposed to do? Stand there, like a good kid, and let him kick my ass?\"\n\"It doesn't matter who started it!\" his dad replied sternly, beginning to raise his voice. \"You took it too far, Luke. You broke his nose, he had to go to the hospital.”\nLucas leaned back in his seat, folding his arms. “Oh well,” he shrugged. “That what he gets for fucking with me.”\nHis father’s tone changed from annoyed to furious. “You’re missing the point!” he shouted, slamming his fist against the steering wheel. “Thank God his parents didn't press charges. You could have been arrested. Is that what you want? A criminal record at sixteen years old!\"\n“All I wanted was to be left alone,” Lucas muttered bitterly, unwilling to put any more energy into the pointless argument.\nThe rest of the car ride carried out in silence. It seemed as though even his dad had grown tired of the predominantly one-sided conversation. Lucas continued staring out the window to his side; the hum of the car engine drowning out his thoughts.\n As they arrived at the school, Lucas noticed the familiar brick buildings that made up the campus. The school's name, Lincoln High, was emblazoned on a large sign near the entrance. The same school that claimed to have a zero-tolerance policy against violence and bullying. Though Lucas felt that they cared more about their test scores and sports teams than individual students.\nLucas’ dad pulled into the parking lot, finally breaking the silence “Just go straight to class,” his dad sighed as the first bell rang in the distance. “We’ll talk about this when you get home.”\n“We’ve been talking about this for weeks!” Lucas snapped as he stepped out of the car. “Clearly you don’t give shit what I say, so just let it go already!” \nLucas slammed the door shut, and stomped before his dad was able to say anything else. His dad sped off in the car as if he were doing the same thing. But Lucas didn’t care; he was just glad that the conversation was over. As he approached the front of the school and made his way through the door, into the sea of other students, he felt both a sense of relief and a sense of dread wash over him.<|end_of_turn|>"}
{"prompt": "翻译解释下面内容\nLift-to-Drag and Flight Range\nT is the average propulsive thrust which the bird has to exert, and this balances D, the average drag. L, the lift, balances the weight. \n T/mg=D/L\nThe work done in flying distance d is equal to Td, proportional to the amount of the fuel (energy) used, or E∼Td∼mgdD\\/L\n E/mg∼d⋅D/L\nThis is proportional to mg. In other words, any bird with a particular value of (L/D) consumes a fixed proportion of its weight in flying a unit distance, regardless of the size. Putting this another way, if a fixed proportion of the weight consists of fuel, the distance which can be flown on migration depends only on the lift : drag ratio. The number of air miles flown by, say, a swan and a hummingbird would be the same if both start with, say, 30% of their take-off weight as fuel, and if both have the same effective lift:drag ratio. \n\nStill, various considerations modify this argument in practice. Larger flyers tend to have better lift-to-drag ratio. Small birds are more affected by wind, etc.<|end_of_turn|>"}

Again, give an explanation. \n- Eval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 3 = = =\n- Goal Checking:\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n- Value: 1. The move is valid, but I'm not sure if it is optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but clearly not optimal.\n\nStage 4: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nAction Item:\n- Decide if to take the move\n - If so, proceed to Stage 5.\n - Else, go back to Stage 2 and choose another move.\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 4 = = =\n- Reflect: Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- Go back to Stage 2.\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 2 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Decision: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n- Next State: \n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 3 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Value: 1. The move is valid, but I'm not sure if it is optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 4 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Reflect: Based on the revised value, I think the plan is an optimal one.\n- Proceed to Stage 5.\n\nStage 5: Execute and move on to the next.\n\nGo back to Stage 1 and plan for the next move (i.e., Move 2).\n\nNow let's try the following game:\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B:\nRod C: [2,1]\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: \nRod B: \nRod C: [3, 2, 1]\n```<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Good morning. My healthcare organization participated in an quality improvement program, which affect our revenue. Below is the explanation of how the payment is determined. I need you to help me to understand this policy. I am a \"high-needs\" entity, I am subject to which quality measures? I am in PY2022 now. 1.1 Application of Quality Assessment to Final Financial Reconciliation\nThe process of determining the impact of quality measurement and performance on the PY Benchmark is summarized in this section using PY2022 as an example. The steps are as follows:\n\n• CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n• Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n• Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n• (PY2023–PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n• (PY2023–PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes—thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nFor PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE’s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE’s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE’s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n• All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n• All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail—all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two measures. The sliding scale allows DCEs to earn back at\n \n\nleast a portion of the 1% withhold, based on their highest measure performance. The details of the sliding scales are presented in Table 2-7. In the example in Step 1 above, where a DCE achieved the 20th percentile for ACR and the 10th percentile"}

{"prompt": "Overview\n========================\n\n\\_A sandbox to test units against each other\\_\n\nThis scene is for testing the design of RTS units. Units can be assembled from prefabs of parts. Components for sensors and behaviours can be added. Part categories include weapons (such as lasers and missiles) and movement systems (like wheels, treads, or propellers).\n\nGame designers will create unit designs from the parts and components, and then place armies of these units in the scene. Units assigned to different teams will fight each other. The game designers will use this to test out new ideas for unit parts and to balance the units.\n\nEventually we'd like to release a game that combines the factory automation and RTS genres and allows players to assemble custom unit designs from parts, using conveyor belts and assemblers.\n\nFile descriptions\n========================\n\n## Behaviours\n\\* UnitBehaviour.cs - Base class for behaviours. Units can have multiple behaviours. Behaviours can be ordered in the editor and they will run in this order. Later behaviours can override actions from earlier behaviours.\n\\* SeekAndDestroy.cs - This behaviour causes a unit to patrol the area for enemies and attack any enemies found on sight.\n\\* Flee.cs - Makes the unit flee from battle. You can set it to only flee when low on health.\n\n## Parts\n\\* UnitPart.cs - Base class for parts. Currently has `weight` and provides a reference to the Unit for convenience. Will probably handle sockets as well.\n\\* Armor.cs - you can add this component to any part or unit. It will give the unit more hit points.\n\\* BasicGun.cs - A gun component. Add as part of a gun prefab to make it shoot. You can set properties of the gun such as the damage, cooldown and range.\n\\* BasicMovement.cs - A movement component. Parts with this component allow the unit to move. You can set properties such as the acceleration, top speed, turning radius, etc.\n\n## Sensors\n\\* Vision.cs - A component that lets the unit detect other units. It sees in a cone in front of the unit.\n\n## Designs\n\\* Peewee - A basic infantry unit with a gun.\n\\* Turret - A stationary, defensive unit with two cannons.\n\n## Other files\n\\* UnitManager.cs\n\\* Unit.cs\n\\* HealthBar.cs\n\n## Interfaces\n\\* IPosition - Anything that has a position. It contains a `Vector3 Position { get; }` property.\n\\* ITargetable - An interface for things that can be targeted, such as units, buildings, or even locations on the map.\n\\* IWeapon - An interface for weapons, such as BasicGun. You can call `SetTarget(ITargetable target)` to set a target for the weapon. The weapon should keep attacking that target automatically until it can't anymore or a new target is set.\n\\* IMovement - An interface for movement components, such as BasicMovement. You an call `SetTarget(ITargetable target, float proximity = 0.5f)` to tell it where to move to. The movement component should automatically move to within `proximity` meters of the target. If the target is a unit, it should follow the unit.\n\\* ISensor - For components that detects units.\n\\* IHealth - Something that has hit points, like a unit or building.\nPossible future features\n========================\n(A lot of these were suggested by ChatGPT)\n\n## Behaviours\n\\* DefendArea.cs: A behavior that makes the unit defend a specific area, engaging enemies that come too close.\n\\* RepairAndSupport.cs: A behavior that enables the unit to repair or support friendly units within a defined radius.\n\n## Parts\n\\* Shield.cs: A component that provides a regenerating energy shield to the unit, which can absorb a certain amount of damage before the armor or hit points are affected.\n\\* StealthSystem.cs: A part that allows the unit to become invisible or difficult to detect by enemy sensors.\n\\* ArtilleryWeapon.cs: A long-range weapon component with customizable attributes, such as projectile type, range, and splash damage.\n\n## Sensors\n\\* Radar.cs: A component that can detect cloaked units.\n\n## Designs\n\\* Scout: A fast-moving unit with enhanced sensors for reconnaissance and intel gathering.\n\\* Engineer: A support unit that can repair, build, or upgrade other units and structures.\n\\* HeavyAssault: A heavily armored unit with multiple weapon systems for dealing with various types of enemy units.\n\n## Utility classes\n\\* FormationManager.cs: A system for managing unit formations, allowing the player to create and modify formations for better control of their units.\n\\* DynamicObstacles.cs: A script that enables the creation of dynamic obstacles, such as destructible terrain or moving hazards, to add complexity and challenge to the sandbox.\n\n## UI\n\\* UnitSelectionUI.cs: A user interface for selecting and controlling individual units or groups of units.\n\\* UnitInfoPanel.cs: A panel that displays detailed information about a selected unit, including its current parts, sensors, and behaviors.\n\\* DesignBlueprintUI.cs: A user interface that allows the player to create, save, and load custom unit designs using available parts, sensors, and behaviors.\n\nPublic classes, properties and methods\n==============\n``` \npublic interface IPosition\n{\n Vector3 Position { get; }\n}\n\npublic interface ITargetable : IPosition\n{\n float Radius { get; }\n bool IsAlive { get; }\n void DealDamage(int damage) { }\n}\n\npublic enum MovementType { Ground, Flying }\n\npublic interface IMovement\n{\n // These stats are public mainly for displaying in the UI.

{"prompt": "help me do minor fixes in this linkedin post. mainly grammar and maybe tone\n\n==\nThe REAL \"dry powder\" in startup ecosystem: IPO backlog.\n\nPitchbook estimates that there are 200+ VC-backed companies that are ready to IPO but are delaying their exit because of market conditions.\n\nFor the last 1.5 years, there has been a significant decrease in IPO numbers, which has had negative repercussions all over the ecosystem.\n\nWhat happens to startup ecosystem when a venture-backed company goes public with high valuation & multiple?\n\n- Example: all ecosystem participants see that exit as a north star & an inspiration. Their multiple becomes a benchmark; company name is used in startup decks.\n\n- Track record for everyone on cap table: Earlier stage VCs get their \"fund returner\". DPI (\"Distributions to Paid in\") goes through the roof; at this point, a fund becomes successful. VCs get a significant boost to their track record, and it becomes much easier for them to raise the next fund. Angels who invested in that company get great track record to help them start new funds.\n\n- Liquidity: VCs that recycle capital now have capital available to invest, without need to fundraise. Angels might have lifechanging capital and can start investing much larger checks. LPs get distributions and can invest in more VC funds.\n\n- Employees becoming LPs: typically, pre-IPO employees have little savings and can't participate in venture ecosystem, unlike big tech (FAANG and alike) employees who are often angels and LPs. Now, at once, we're getting hundreds or thousands of newly rich people who want to \"give back\" to the ecosystem that made them rich.\n\nWhen IPO season starts again in earnest, we'll see many more new VC funds crop up everywhere. I know quite a few great new fund managers that have way smaller funds than they could just because too many potential LPs say, \"I love your fund, and I would definitely invest, I just don't have liquidity right now - need to wait for an IPO\". \n\nI don't know when this IPO traffic jam will start clearing up. But when it does, I expect it will be much easier to fundraise for both funds and startups.\n==<|end_of_turn|>"}

The idea revolves around a cybernetic AI system powered via precognition through a blockchain associative remote viewing game, a game with minimal UI that people of all languages can play (as long as they have internet. This allows the decentralized AI to tell people to spend their money on specific things which the precognitive mechanism detects will steer the future in a positive manner.

Blockchain ARV games are a form of decentralized prediction market that uses human intuition to forecast future events. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are organizations run by rules encoded as computer programs on a blockchain. Direct democracy is a form of democracy in which people decide on policy initiatives directly, rather than through representatives.\n\nThought: Based on my understanding of these concepts, I can now create a solution for the novel by connecting the key components in a coherent manner.\n\nThought: The solution must involve a cybernetic AI system, powered by a blockchain ARV game, that allows for the redistribution of wealth while ensuring unbiased decision-making through human input.\n\nSolution:\n\nIn the novel, the AI system, called Ethos,\n```<|end_of_turn|>"}

The development and integration of advanced XR hardware components, including the use of already available technologies, such as chips, displays, optics and sensors, for a new generation of XR devices providing greater visual, wearable, vestibular and social comfort. Special relevance should be given (a) to technological breakthroughs in photonics and new materials aiming to increase the image quality and to reduce the size and weight of XR devices; (b) to displays and optical elements bringing the capabilities of XR devices closer to those of the human vision; (c) to more efficient architectures for enhanced performance, reduced power consumption and improved heat dissipation; (d) to novel systems that cater to the widest range of users, including those that need prescription correction; (e) to advanced optical- and photo-detector technologies for sensing systems, including sensing data processing; (f) to innovative XR connectivity components supporting the demanding requirements on latency, data rates and resilience; and (g) to novel materials with tailored optical, mechanical and processing properties for a tight integration of subcomponents, enabling overall miniaturization and environmentally sustainable mass-production of future XR devices.\n\nAt least one proposal of this type will be funded.\n\nii. The development of new solutions aiming to improve the user experience, skills and capacity in social and professional XR setups. This includes tools and services for the creation and management of interactive virtual worlds such as metaverse and 3D models, realistic full body avatars and intelligent agents. The solutions should also seek to enhance the interoperability, performance and accessibility of XR experiences. The proposals should include prototypes validated in realistic scenarios, proving how innovative the developed solutions are, how they exploit synergies between disciplines and domains, and how far beyond state of the art they go.\n\nAt least one proposal of this type will be funded.\n\nThe Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.\n\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\n\nSpecific Topic Conditions:\nActivities are expected to start at TRL 2 and achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.\n\nGot that? We're working on a new use case for the proposed project, and I'd like you to help suggest ideas/changes/additions on its section regarding the importance of this use case on achieving the objectives of the project.

{"prompt": "Okay so we have this assignment, that i think is supposed to be using linear programming. here it is:\n1\nAssignment 1: Use appliances intelligently \nat your home\nGeneral Consideration\nAssignment 1 concentrates on demand response. The work to undertake involves a bit of \nmathematical modelling, implementation in your favorite programming language \nPython/Java/R/Matlab/etc.), generation and discussion of results, as well as presentation of \nthe work in a short report.\nThe expected outcome of Assignment 1 includes: \n• a report in PDF\n• code pasted in the appendix of the report; or as supplementary material\nAssignment 1 is to be performed in groups, where a group can consist of 4 students (or 3 \nstudents when there are PhD students in the group).\nThe evaluation of Assignment 1 will count for 15% of the grade. All students in the same \ngroup receive the same grade.\nDescription of the Assignment\nEach household has combination of the following appliances. Typical appliances included for \nthe purpose of Illustration. In practice, households may have a variety of other appliances. \nThe daily consumption of each household is divided into a 24-slot time-frame with each slot \ncorresponding to an hour period.\nAppliances with strict consumption scheduling (non-shiftable appliances) in each household\n- Lighting: (daily usage for standard bulbs: 1.00-2.00 kWh from 10:00 - 20:00), \n- Heating: (daily usage: 6.4-9.6 kWh including floor heating)\n- Refrigerator- freezer (daily usage: 1.32-3.96 kWh, depending on the number of \nrefrigerators in the house; Consumption for 1 refrigerator including freezer=1.32 \nKWh),\n- Electric stove (daily usage: 3.9 kWh)\n- TV: (daily usage: 0.15-0.6 KWh depending on the TV size @ 5hours of use per day)\n- Computer including desktop(s), laptop(s) (Number: 1-3; daily 0.6KWh per day per \ncomputer)\nConsumption of shiftable appliances\n- Dishwasher: (daily usage: 1.44 kWh)\n- Laundry machine: (daily usage: 1.94 kWh)\n- Cloth dryer: (daily usage: 2.50 kWh)\n- Electric Vehicle (EV): (daily usage: 9.9 kWh)\nTypical consumption values refer to [1], [2], with slight variations for different appliances. In \na residential area, without any intelligent scheduling, the power demand is usually light-to-\n2\nmoderate during mornings, higher during evenings and low during nights. Considering this, \nwe need to assign the time slots in hours as required for the non-shiftable appliances, and \nprovide a range of possible time slots for operating the shiftable appliances.\n1. We have a simple household that only has three appliances: a washing machine, an EV \nand a dishwasher. We assume the time-of-Use (ToU) pricing scheme: 1NOK/KWh for \npeak hour and 0.5NOK/KWh for off-peak hours. Peak hours are in the range of 5:00pm\u00028:00pm while all other timeslots are off-peak hours. Formulate an optimization problem \nto obtain minimum energy cost and then design a strategy to achieve minimum energy \ncost.\nNote: We need a strategy, not just the amount of the minimal energy cost. For example, \nyou may need to consider some questions. Is it reasonable to use all three appliances at \nthe same time, e.g., 2:00am which has the low energy price? How should we distribute \nthe power load more reasonably in the timeline?\n2. We have a household with all non-shiftable appliances and all shiftable appliances (see \nthe two lists aforementioned). In addition to these, please choose a random combination \nof appliances such as coffee maker, ceiling fan, hair dryer, toaster, microwave, router,\ncellphone charger, cloth iron, separate freezer(s), etc., for the household. Please refer to \n[2] to add typical energy consumption values for the appliances. Please use Real-Time \nPricing (RTP) scheme. The RTP model is followed: using a random function to generate \nthe pricing curve in a day and please save the pricing information (the pricing \ninformation will be also used in question 4). The pricing curve should consider higher\nprice in the peak-hours and lower price in the off-peak hours. Compute the best strategy\nto schedule the use of the appliances and write a program in order to minimize energy \ncost.\n3. We consider a small neighborhood that has 30 households. Each household has the same \nsetting as that in question 2. But, we assume that only a fraction of the households owns\nan EV. Please use Real-Time Pricing (RTP) scheme: using random function to generate the \npricing curve in a day. The pricing curve should consider higher price in the peak-hours \nand lower price in the off-peak hours. Compute the best strategy for scheduling the \nappliances and write a program in order to minimize energy cost in the neighborhood.\n4. In question 2, we may observe that in some timeslots, energy consumption is very high.\nSuch peak load phenomena may damage the smart grid stability. In this task, please \naddress this issue. One possible approach is to introduce a new variable L representing \nthe peak load. Then, the objective function should consider both energy cost and the \npeak load. A new constraint should be also added to consider that the total energy \nconsumption of all appliances in the house in any timeslot is not higher than the peak \nload L. Please formulate an optimization problem and compute the best strategy to \nschedule the use of the appliances. Please use the same setting of the appliances, and \nthe price information you saved in question 2. \nStructure and contents of the report to be delivered\nThe report for the assignment should include: \n• Question 1, calculate the minimal energy consumption and explain the main \n3\nconsiderations to the developed strategy. \n• Question 2, the formulation of the demand response as a linear programming \noptimization problem. Please use a figure to show the pricing curve. Please explain on \nhow the problem is solved and probably draw the flowchart to illustrate the main \nalgorithm(s).\n• Question 3, the formulation of the demand response as an optimization problem. Please \nuse a figure to show the pricing curve. Please explain how the problem is solved and you \nmay draw the flowchart to illustrate the main algorithms.\n• Question 4, the formulation of the demand response as an optimization problem. Please \ncompare the scheduling result of the appliances in question 2 and question 4; and \nexplain the main difference of the energy consumption.\n• A short analysis of two different pricing schemes (ToU and RTP) impact on the energy \ncost\n• The code in an Appendix (if not provided separately)\nDelivery of the Assignment \nAssignment 1 is to be sent to the following email \nEmail: sabita@ifi.uio.no , yanzhang@ifi.uio.no and poushals@ifi.uio.no\nSubmission form: the submission should be in a ZIP file with naming convention “IN5410-\nAssignment1 - GroupX.zip\", where “X” is the group number. \nEmail subject: “[IN5410] Assignment 1 submission by Group X”\nFirm deadline: 19 March 2023. Please be reminded that this is firm deadline. Groups that \nsend reports after this deadline will receive the grade “F”.\nQuestions? please contact Poushali Sengupta.

{"prompt": "can you write a detailed short story outline for this: A story about a crime and community service future society where you’re given a quick ai assessment of your skills after a brief interview and body scan. For smaller infringements there’s a lot more focus in the society on community service than there is on fines, after all fines really only affect rich folk. There are different tiers to community service though based on how important the work is and how few people there are to do it. You can pick what you want to do. Some people don’t have a lot of skills or they do and they pick something easy and end up doing a bunch of manual labor. Others do data entry. The work that pays the best is those mime work. Not everyone is suited for it. Looks and activity and age all matter. But for those that fit the skill well, few things pay better. Lots of eligible people would rather sign up for an afternoon of work rather than suffer through a week picking up trash at the side of the road. Not everyone is suited for it and mime work can be emotionally and physically exhaustive. you can always tap out. Everyone makes sure you can get out but if you do, you get zero credit. So this story is about two friends who were in trouble for using ai for plagiarism in one of their college courses. They signed up together and when they were looking through the jobs on their personal devices they both laughed at first. How hilarious is it that they both scored so high on the mime service. Neither of them had been a mime. Well not professionally. They’d both done mime stuff just for fun. Little bit here and there and never in public. The idea seemed so humiliating and they talk about it a bit. One girl had a friend who did it and they assigned her in an other town and no one knew until she started telling people herself. She was proud, apparently that she got the rumors going herself, or at least that’s what she said. so the two friends were looking at the different options for being a mime. They could mime privately once for a single person over the course of an entire week. They could do hand miming for patients at the hospital and senior center. But that was for three shifts of four hours. There were so many options. They could even spend one six hour shift miming at a women’s only mime club. They considered that even though neither of them had performed for women and weren’t interested in trying it. But the two friends were fans of the easy way out and there was an opening at the central square in Waterford, about thirty minutes away. It was government run place for mimes. They’d seen it and even known some seniors at their high school who said they went there all the time and it was expensive but worth it. But this gig was different. They would be performing in the kiosk. It was almost like an atm booth. Lots and lots of turnover. They had all seen it. It was a separate door and there was usually short line outside but the people came and went so the line never got too long. It was mostly men on their way home who wanted to see a quick mime show. it was into the kiosk and back out. So if the two friends each signed up for that it was only two hours of service each. They weren’t sure how long it would take for each person to see them mime. One of the friends assumed it would probably be four or five per hours because people must take a bit before they were done watching. so the girls sign up. The day of thought they are told something a little scary. Everyone in line watches. Some people like watching others watch a mime show. One of the friends brothers knew how it worked and they admitted going to a few times. Everyone only had five minutes to watch but that’s usually all they ever needed because there was a special mime makeup they could apply to themselves before stepping up for their turn to see the show themselves. When wearing that themselves it always went faster. the friend had to call to arrange a time when they could go together but they found out they would be at two different stations in the same “gallery” as it was called. the day of they arrived a little late so they missed half of the orientation but said it was fine. One of them covered for the other, saying they had been there before and knew the drill. That wasn’t a great idea. They were brought to their mime stations and locked into place. It was punitive miming so they weren’t shocked they had to mime in a stockade but they did anyway. The bulk of the story is a description of each of the men (and a couple women actually) who visited. It’s important to always look your best when being a mime so there was a hose and a pump dispenser with makeup there. It was a strange makeup though and both of the women found that it tingled a bit but the makeup from the dispenser actually felt nice. Which was good because the perfances themselves were exhausting and they never stopped comming. The bulk of the story is made of details of the individual encounters. Then at the end they were removed, exhausted from the stockage and placed in an after show lounge where they decompressed for a bit and shared stories. They ended up performing for each other because they were worked up from performing as a mime for everyone else. Then the story ends.<|end_of_turn|>"}

Deep down, he may wonder about their fates and whether he'll ever see them again.\nFlaws:\n\nCowardice: When faced with serious consequences or confrontation, Jean-Baptiste has a tendency to flee rather than face his problems head-on.\n\nBiography:\nJean-Baptiste DuBois was born into a minor noble family in a beautiful coastal region reminiscent of the Mediterranean. As the eldest son, he was groomed to inherit the family estate and title. Educated in hunting, swordsmanship, poetry, and diplomacy, Jean-Baptiste preferred chasing romantic interests and engaging in mischief with the servants' children.\n\nHis parents arranged his marriage to Aurelie, the daughter of an influential merchant family. After Aurelie became pregnant, Jean-Baptiste felt trapped and abandoned his wife and unborn child. He joined a merchant ship, only to find himself lured into a life of piracy. Eventually, he fled the pirate crew after a confrontation with the captain.\n\nJean-Baptiste now wanders the world as a rogue, seeking adventure and evading his past. He harbors guilt for abandoning his family and wonders about their fate. His desire for freedom clashes with his longing for love and stability. Skilled in stealth, deception, and persuasion, Jean-Baptiste's weakness is his cowardice. The choices you make as Jean-Baptiste will shape his destiny and the lives of those he encounters.\n\nThe story so far:\nThe setting of the campaign has a Mediterranean theme with a fantasy twist, fitting with the general lore of Dungeons and Dragons. The story takes place in the coastal town of Sirena's Call. I have just successfully completed a heist, retrieving the Eye of the Kraken from the mansion of a wealthy merchant named Horatio de Vallo.\n\nDuring the heist, I acquired additional loot, including a golden necklace with a sapphire pendant and a small golden dragon statuette. I split the reward with my contact Renard 80-20 and kept the additional loot for myself. Now, I'm considering my next move and looking for new opportunities and adventures in the world.\n\nAs the Dungeon Master, please provide me with choices, challenges, and opportunities to make decisions, and guide me through a mixture of roleplaying, exploration, and combat. Remember that Jean-Baptiste speaks with a French accent. Let me control my character's actions and dialogue while you manage the world, NPCs, and gameplay mechanics. Please adhere to the rules of D&D 5e and involve dice rolls when appropriate.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "MENGAPA BERPOLITIK\n\nOleh: Aang Kunaifi\nPolitical Trainer\n\nAda banyak alasan seseorang dalam berpolitik. Alasannya bisa mulia, tapi bisa juga tidak. Alasannya bisa untuk bangsa dan negara, juga kemanusiaan. Tapi bisa juga untuk kepentingan diri sendiri. \n\nTapi yang harus diingat oleh setiap politisi, bahwa politik itu adalah tentang merebut dan mempertahankan kekuasaan. Artinya, apapun alasan seseorang dalam berpolitik, ia harus ingat bahwa ia punya kerja besar, yaitu merebut dan mempertahankan kekuasaan.\n\nTentang merebut dan mempertahankan kekuasaan, merupakan makna paling mendasar dari politik. Karena itu, ia harus dipahami secara utuh dan komprehensif. Jika tidak, justru politisi tersebut akan mengalami disorientasi.\n\nSaya beberapa kali mendengar cerita tentang politisi yang justru tidak menganggap penting kekuasaan, sehingga tidak serius merebutnya. Atau mempertahankannya. Ia melakukannya sebagai wujud dari idealismenya, bahwa kekuasaan bukan segala-galanya. \n\nSekilas apa yang dilakukannya begitu mulia. Ia tidak terjebak dengan godaan kekuasaan. Tapi politisi yang seperti ini, justru telah kehilangan orientasi. Ia tidak serius memperjuangkan sesuatu yang paling mendasar dalam politik. \n\nTapi di sudut yang lain. Ada juga saya temui, politisi yang justru menjadikan kekuasaan sebagai segala-galanya. Sangat serius dan sungguh-sungguh memperjuangkannya. Bahkan, ia mau melakukan segala cara. Tidak masalah jika harus berbuat curang, melanggar hukum, serta tipu daya lainnya. \n\nSekilas apa yang dilakukannya benar, karena memang politik adalah tentang merebut dan mempertahankan kekuasaan. Tapi ia lupa bahwa kekuasaan bukan tujuan akhir. Kekuasaan justru merupakan sarana untuk mendapatkan tujuan yang lebih besar.\n\nLalu, bagaimana seharusnya? \n\nDalam berpolitik, seorang politisi tentu harus berjuang untuk merebut kekuasaan. Juga mempertahankannya, jika kekuasaan tersebut sudah ada dalam genggaman tangan. Merebut dan mempertahankan kekuasaan bukanlah hal yang tabu. Jangankan dalam dunia politik, dalam kehidupan sehari-hari saja, hal tersebut mungkin pernah dan sering kita lakukan.\n.\nTapi harus diingat, bahwa dalam merebut dan mempertahankan kekuasaan, ada aturan yang tidak boleh dilanggar. Ada etika yang harus dihormati. Ada sikap respek yang harus dikedepankan. Dalam berpolitik, kita tidak boleh menghalalkan segala cara. Dalam berpolitik, ada prinsip-prinsip yang tetap harus dijaga.\n.\nPerlu diingat juga, bahwa kekuasaan bukanlah tujuan akhir. Ia adalah sarana untuk mendapatkan atau melakukan hal yang lebih besar dan substantif. Karena itu, seorang politisi harus ideologis. Harus jelas apa yang diperjuangkan.\n.\nDalam berpolitik, semakin besar dan kuat apa yang diperjuangkan, maka semakin besar kemungkinan keberhasilannya. Hal ini sesuai dengan apa yang disampaikan oleh Simon Sinek dalam bukunya Start with Why. Juga Angela Duckworth di dalam bukunya yang berjudul Grit.\n.\nDua orang pakar dalam dunia pengembangan diri ini bersepakat kalau tujuan seseorang dalam melakukan sesuatu, akan menjadi salah satu faktor penentu keberhasilan mereka dalam melakukan sesuatu. Simon menyebutnya WHY, sedang Angela menyebutkan tujuan.\n.\nKarena itu, balik lagi lagi ke dunia politik, seorang politisi harus mempunyai alasan dan tujuan yang besar dan kuat, kenapa mereka harus berpolitik. Semakin besar semakin bagus. Semakin kuat semakin bagus.\n.\nKenapa besar dan kuat? kenapa bukan tujuan yang positif?\n\nDalam politik, benar dan salah itu tidak menentukan. Justru kuat dan lemah yang punya pengaruh. Jika anda benar, tapi lemah, maka anda akan kalah. Tapi jika anda kuat, pun anda salah, anda akan menang.\n.\nBetul bahwa dalam politik, anda harus melakukan hal yang benar. Anda harus berada dalam posisi yang benar. Tapi kebenaran yang anda perjuangkan, harus berdampingan dengan kekuatan.\n.\nKaidah yang sama berlaku pada alasan dan tujuan anda berpolitik. Jika alasan anda benar, dan tujuan anda adalah tujuan yang baik, ia seolah jadi percuma dan sia-sia, jika alasan dan tujuan anda itu, tidak besar dan kuat.\n.\nSebaliknya, sangat mungkin dalam politik, ada orang yang mempunyai tujuan yang buruk, maka sangat mungkin tujuannya akan tercapai jika tujuan dan alasannya itu besar dan kuat.\n.\nKarena itu, milikilah alasan dan tujuan dalam berpolitik. Tidak hanya sekedar merebut dan mempertahankan kekuasaan. Tapi bagaimana caranya agar kekuasaan yang berhasil digenggam, bisa digunakan untuk tujuan dan alasan yang mulia.\n.\nTapi ingat, tidak cukup dengan alasan yang mulia saja. Alasan itu harus kuat, harus besar. Dengan besar dan kuatnya alasan dan tujuan yang dimiliki, anda sebagai politisi, akan semakin tabah dan tangguh dalam mengarungi dunia politik yang keras.\n.\nSekian\n\\*Ak\n\nberikan critical review terhadap tulisan ini<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Paper Name: My Tweets Bring All the Traits to the Yard: Predicting Personality and Relational Traits in Online Social Networks\n\nAbstract: Users in Online Social Networks (OSNs,) leave traces that reflect their personality characteristics. The study of these traces is important for several fields, such as social science, psychology, marketing, and others. Despite a marked increase in research on personality prediction based on online behavior, the focus has been heavily on individual personality traits, and by doing so, largely neglects relational facets of personality. This study aims to address this gap by providing a prediction model for holistic personality profiling in OSNs that includes socio-relational traits (attachment orientations) in combination with standard personality traits. Specifically, we first designed a feature engineering methodology that extracts a wide range of features (accounting for behavior, language, and emotions) from the OSN accounts of users. Subsequently, we designed a machine learning model that predicts trait scores of users based on the extracted features. The proposed model architecture is inspired by characteristics embedded in psychology; i.e, it utilizes interrelations among personality facets and leads to increased accuracy in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we applied our model on two datasets, namely regular OSN users and opinion leaders on social media, and contrast both samples’ psychological profiles. Our findings demonstrate that the two groups can be clearly separated by focusing on both Big Five personality traits and attachment orientations. The presented research provides a promising avenue for future research on OSN user characterization and classification.\n\nIntroduction: Online Social Networks (OSNs) offer a virtual space in which people connect and interact with others, express themselves, and receive information, in a continuous digital reflection of the real (offline) world. In OSNs, people typically showcase their real self [40] and leave traces in online behavior, which reflect their real-world personality [24]. These traces expose a holistic image of oneself, including both personal characteristics (personality traits) and characteristics that portray their behavior in relation to others (relational traits).\n\nThe term personality refers to characteristic combinations or patterns of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional reactions that evolve from biological and environmental factors and form relatively consistent individual differences [13]. The Big Five (BF) or Five Factor model [29] is one of the most distinctive personality theories that constitutes five main traits of human personality representing individual differences in cognition, emotion, and behavior: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. On the other hand, relational traits have also been linked with consistencies in social behavior and interaction patterns, with attachment theory [7] as the most emblematic theoretical framework in that respect [31, 43], capturing how individuals experience close relationships to and interactions with others.\n\nPersonality traits have been studied in the context of OSNs and the web overall, as findings show that they are strongly linked to OSN use [57], online friendships [60], and online reviews [52]. Moreover, certain prediction models have been proposed [37, 64] to extract users’ psychological background from their online behavioral residue and map it to personality characteristics. However, relational traits such as attachment orientations (AO) have been overlooked in online environments, even though user activity in OSNs heavily relates to social behavior characteristics. This makes the study of a relational profile critical from an application point of view and provides rich information about individuals’ social profile.\n\nThe present research aims to address this limitation in OSN research, by studying and predicting both relational traits and personality traits of users. The importance of relational facets of personality for explaining social interaction cannot be overstated. Given that online social media engagement resembles actual social interactions in many respects [15, 30], the need to study how different personality facets are reflected in online expression is particularly compelling. Attachment orientations, a key individual difference of relational orientation, can be derived on the basis of traces found in micro-blogs. Attachment orientations capture one’s notion of the self in relation to others and interpersonal relationships, with attachment theory being one of the key personality theoretical frames to explain actual social behavior [31]. Considering both traditional personality Big Five traits and relational traits is important for (1) providing holistic profiling of OSN users—humans have an integrated profile in which self and social aspects interrelate and affect each other, and joint profiling can be essential for understanding the overall human presence on OSNs; (2) uncovering more traits of people’s psychological and social world has been identified as a direction in OSN research (which currently focuses only on the personality traits) that could help to better explain, analyze, and predict online user behavior [66], e.g., with applications on customer segmentation [46] or digital advertisement environments [17]; and (3) shedding light on social interaction phenomena taking place in OSNs is of great socioeconomic importance, e.g., community formation [32], decision making [42], or information diffusion [12].\n\nTo this end, the present article proposes a novel data-driven approach to predict a holistic psychological profile of OSN users, capturing both their personality and relational traits.1 Building on insights stemming from psychology theory, our approach applies data mining on OSN textual and non-textual data, carefully selects different sets of features for predicting different types of traits, and exploits the inherent correlations in psychological traits, to efficiently predict a complete image of OSN users’ psychological profile. The proposed approach is applied on the Twitter micro-blogging service, which stands as a live, dynamic, and open OSN platform on which people intensively interact, and is largely driven by people’s spontaneous reactions and emotions expressing themselves (personality facet) and interacting with others (relational facet) at the same time.\n\nSpecifically, our contributions in detail are as follows:\n\nData mining and feature engineering for psychology traces in OSN. Motivated by psychology theory on personality suggesting that traits are reflected in different types of online behavior and actions, we identify a large set of features that capture language, behavioral, and emotional expressions of users in OSNs. The proposed feature engineering methodology accounts for a larger set of features than those considered in previous works, thus allowing to target more generic psychological profiling. To apply and test our methodology, we collected a labeled dataset: through a crowdsourcing platform, we recruited 243 individuals who consented to provide information about their psychology profiles. Subsequently, we compiled a ground-truth dataset labeled with their psychology profiles. We used the Twitter API to collect 350,000 tweets from the Twitter accounts of recruited participants and applied the proposed feature engineering methodology.\n\nHolistic psychological profiling. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) methodology to predict users’ holistic psychological profile including both Big Five personality and relational traits. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that it (1) uses a large set of the collected (psychological-related) features, (2) carefully selects the subsets of them with the strongest predictive power for each trait, and (3) exploits correlations between personality and relational (i.e., social) behavior traits to enhance individual trait predictions. In this way, our approach not only predicts social facets of a psychology profile (which is not captured by existing personality prediction models) along with personality facets but also leverages the different traits for more accurate holistic profile prediction.\n\nNew insights and improvement of prediction accuracy. Evaluating our methodology reveals interesting insights for the prediction of psychology traits from OSN traces: (1) using different sets of features performs better in predicting different psychological traits, (2) relational traits can be predicted as efficiently as personality traits, and (3) holistic personality prediction outperforms individual trait predicting models. We believe that our findings can pave the ground for future experimentation and studies in psychology profiling in OSNs. Moreover, the accuracy achieved by our approach (across all traits) is higher than current state-of-the-art approaches, which currently are limited to Big Five personality traits instead of relational traits. For example, applying the approach of [12] to our data provides a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.284, while our prediction model achieves a 29% improvement for personality traits (RMSE = 0.203) and has 32% better average performance when accounting for all traits (0.192 RMSE); this improvement comes as a result of using both a psychology-driven feature engineering methodology"}

Sounds like a tough job! How are you planning to make it fun and engaging?\nI gotta say, your project sounds like a real tearjerker. How are you going to handle the emotional aspects of discussing cancer with children?\nI'm sure you're facing some pushback from people who think that cancer is too heavy a topic for kids. How are you responding to those critics?\nOkay, okay, let's get real for a second. You're students trying to create a cartoon. What makes you think you can actually make a difference with this project?\nI know firsthand how hard it is to fund creative projects.

What kind of impact do you think that could have on kids who are dealing with genetic diseases?\nI think it's so important to create resources that can help children understand complex topics. How do you think your cartoon could help break down some of the barriers that prevent kids from learning about science and genetics?\nJimmy Kimmel: \"So you guys are students, not professionals in the field of animation or medicine.

So let's jump right in!\nFirst off, I'm curious, what inspired you guys to take on such a heavy topic and create a show for kids?\nNow, let's talk about the characters in your series. Who are they and how do they help explain the message about cancer to children?\nMoney talk time! How are you planning to use the funds from your Kickstarter campaign to finance this project? Our viewers would love to know.\nIt's great that you're creating something to help children understand such a complex disease. But how do you plan to reach your target audience with this show? Have you thought about distribution yet?\nI think it's fantastic that you're using animation to educate children about cancer.

What are some of the biggest obstacles you've faced so far in creating this series, and how have you overcome them?\nHave you received any feedback from people who have seen your show? What have they said about it?\nYou've got a Kickstarter campaign running right now. How can our viewers contribute to your project and what kind of rewards can they expect?\nWhat are your plans for the future once the show is completed and released? Are there any other topics you're interested in exploring through animation?\nAnd last but not least, what message would you like to send to kids and families who could benefit from your show, and to anyone who wants to support your Kickstarter campaign?<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Danny DeMichele \n7:40 PM (0 minutes ago)\nto me\n\nI want to create an extremely thorough white paper outline that goes really deep into how to use gpt for marketing. The following are the high level topics that I want you to fill in sub topics for. This will be written for marketers who aren’t interested in the actual technology behind the scenes, these people want actionable insights that can help them understand the concepts, how to use it, breakdown of each tactic of digital marketing. The following is a high level summary of the key points I care about, this is just to ensure you include the main components, but you can create the outline in whatever flow you feel is neccessary. Please use the following high level information and provide a thorough outline/table of contents of all the topics we will cover. Here is a high level flow. Once we are done with this outline/table of contents\n\n1. Intro into chat gpt and how fast it’s moving so far. Explaining the general power enhancements that a marketer cares about (ie; intelligence, the amount of words it can input / output, etc.). And the speed of adoption will be the quickest we have ever seen in our history. Faster than the internet. There are just very little friction points to adopt.\n\n2. The importance of rethinking every marketing process internally and the possible need to restructure the org chart. Yes you can get the benefit if your staff is using GPT individually, but if you implement at the process level, it will help a long term transformation of your company. And the realitiy is, you may need different types of staff versus have you have it now.\n\n3. People are not using it to near its full potential, in our view, the focus needs to be on how you prime GPT with as much information as it would need to do the job right. Lots of ways to do this, but think of GPT as you would a new contractor or employee. You wouldnt just ask them to perform a task without giving them info. Information about the company, why you need whatever task there is.\n-From here, please break down what a sequence prompt is. \n-the importance of prompt engineering / priming.\n-Asking the right question once you have primed GPT.\n\n4. Now I want to dive into several marketing tactics to help structure the output. Please include the following parts:\n-Ideation - get rid of the \"blank page\" syndrome and have GPT help with campaign ideation. new topics, fresh ideas, etc. Great for brainstorming.\n-Customer service - Using it to assist staff to get people quick answers.\n-SEO - break down what GPT can do for SEO including keyword research, competitive research, content, meta data, link building.\n-Social Media - research, posts, engagement.\n-Paid media - research, data analyzing, landing page creation, ad copy creation.\n-Email MArketing - creation of ideas, sequence flows, data analysis.\n\nPlease write in English language.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Understand context and reply Yes \"\"\" Linking and Navigating\nThe Next.js router uses server-centric routing with client-side navigation. It supports instant loading states and concurrent rendering. This means navigation maintains client-side state, avoids expensive re-renders, is interruptible, and doesn't cause race conditions.\n\nThere are two ways to navigate between routes:\n\n Component\nuseRouter Hook\nThis page will go through how to use , useRouter(), and dive deeper into how navigation works.\n\n Component\n is a React component that extends the HTML element to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.\n\nUsage\nTo use , import it from next/link, and pass a href prop to the component:\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport Link from 'next/link';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n return Dashboard;\n}\nThere are optional props you can pass to . See the API reference for more information.\n\nExample: Linking to Dynamic Segments\nWhen linking to dynamic segments, you can use template literals and interpolation to generate a list of links. For example, to generate a list of blog posts:\n\napp/blog/PostList.jsx\nimport Link from 'next/link';\n\nexport default function PostList({ posts }) {\n return (\n \n {posts.map((post) => (\n * {post.title}\n\n ))}\n \n\n );\n}\nuseRouter() Hook\nThe useRouter hook allows you to programmatically change routes inside Client Components.\n\nTo use useRouter, import it from next/navigation, and call the hook inside your Client Component:\n\n'use client';\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n const router = useRouter();\n\n return (\n router.push('/dashboard')}>\n Dashboard\n \n );\n}\nThe useRouter provides methods such as push(), refresh(), and more. See the API reference for more information.\n\nRecommendation: Use the component to navigate between routes unless you have a specific requirement for using useRouter.\n\nHow Navigation Works\nA route transition is initiated using or calling router.push().\nThe router updates the URL in the browser’s address bar.\nThe router avoids unnecessary work by re-using segments that haven't changed (e.g. shared layouts) from the client-side cache. This is also referred to as partial rendering.\nIf the conditions of soft navigation are met, the router fetches the new segment from the cache rather than the server. If not, the router performs a hard navigation and fetches the Server Component payload from the server.\nIf created, loading UI is shown from the server while the payload is being fetched.\nThe router uses the cached or fresh payload to render the new segments on the client.\nClient-side Caching of Rendered Server Components\nGood to know: This client-side cache is different from the server-side Next.js HTTP cache.\n\nThe new router has an in-memory client-side cache that stores the rendered result of Server Components (payload). The cache is split by route segments which allows invalidation at any level and ensures consistency across concurrent renders.\n\nAs users navigate around the app, the router will store the payload of previously fetched segments and prefetched segments in the cache.\n\nThis means, for certain cases, the router can re-use the cache instead of making a new request to the server. This improves performance by avoiding re-fetching data and re-rendering components unnecessarily.\n\nInvalidating the Cache\nThe cache can be invalidated using router.refresh(). For more information, see the API reference. In the future, mutations will automatically invalidate the cache.\n\nPrefetching\nPrefetching is a way to preload a route in the background before it's visited. The rendered result of prefetched routes is added to the router's client-side cache. This makes navigating to a prefetched route near-instant.\n\nBy default, routes are prefetched as they become visible in the viewport when using the component. This can happen when the page first loads or through scrolling. Routes can also be programmatically prefetched using the prefetch method of the useRouter() hook.\n\nStatic and Dynamic Routes:\n\nIf the route is static, all the Server Component payloads for the route segments will be prefetched.\nIf the route is dynamic, the payload from the first shared layout down until the first loading.js file is prefetched. This reduces the cost of prefetching the whole route dynamically and allows instant loading states for dynamic routes.\nGood to know:\n\nPrefetching is only enabled in production.\nPrefetching can be disabled by passing prefetch={false} to .\nHard Navigation\nOn navigation, the cache is invalidated and the server refetches data and re-renders the changed segments.\n\nSoft Navigation\nOn navigation, the cache for changed segments is reused (if it exists), and no new requests are made to the server for data.\n\nConditions for Soft Navigation\nOn navigation, Next.js will use soft navigation if the route you are navigating to has been prefetched, and either doesn't include dynamic segments or has the same dynamic parameters as the current route.\n\nFor example, consider the following route that includes a dynamic [team] segment: /dashboard/[team]/\\*. The cached segments below /dashboard/[team]/\\* will only be invalidated when the [team] parameter changes.\n\nNavigating from /dashboard/team-red/\\* to /dashboard/team-red/\\* will be a soft navigation.\nNavigating from /dashboard/team-red/\\* to /dashboard/team-blue/\\* will be a hard navigation.\nBack/Forward Navigation\nBack and forward navigation (popstate event) has a soft navigation behavior. This means, the client-side cache is re-used and navigation is near-instant.\n\nFocus and Scroll Management\nBy default, Next.js will set focus and scroll into view the segment that's changed on navigation. The importance of this accessibility and usability feature will be more apparent when advanced routing patterns are implemented.\n\nGood to know: Next.js used to wrap each segment in a div element to achieve this behavior. This is now fixed as on the latest Next.js canary. Update to next@canary to get the latest fixes.\n\nNext Steps\n`next/link` API Reference\nPerform client-side route transitions.\n`useRouter` API Reference\nProgrammatically navigate to a new route. \"\"\"<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Let's play a puzzle role-playing escape room game! I'll give you the situation, and you have to solve puzzles. You can interact with a number of items in the room, just tell me what you do and then I'll respond with what happens. \n\nHere's the introduction:\n\nYour eyes feel sore and unwilling to open. Your brain is fuzzy. The last thing you remember, your sword was at your side and you were struggling to get your armour-clad body from one end of the Jade Forest to the other. The Queen's youngest son James had been taken hostage, and she was hiring only the best knights in the realm to negotiate his return, hence your journey. But you never made it to the palace. Instead, as you traversed the trees you were surrounded by a mysterious grey fog, which knocked you unconscious. Now, here you are.\nYou finally get your eyes open. You're inside a small hut, lying sprawled on the floor in front of a closed door. There are high wooden rafters on the ceiling above you. A small chest of drawers sits to the left of the door, and in the near right corner is a bed. There's a toad sitting on the pillow. Leaning against the right wall is a broom, and by the left wall are three large, identical brewing cauldrons. Against the centre of the far wall is a cupboard, and hanging from mounts on that wall are three swords. Kind of like yours. And in the far right corner, there's a small barred cell. Kind of like a prison cell.\nAnd... in the middle of the room, wearing a pointed hat and a greying collection of stitched- together rags, waving her hand over a crystal ball... you know who it is. It's the Jade Witch Shoshana. You thought she was a myth.\nShe bares her pointed teeth at you when she sees you're awake. “I do so love it when intruders into my forest trigger my smoke trap. They black out and do anything I say! Including follow me back to my home. Lie flat on the floor until I'm ready for them. Even eat Wild Deathspore mushrooms and let the poison take care of them so I don't have to!”\nWild Deathspores? No. It can't be. If she's telling the truth, if you unknowingly ate them, you'll be dead in... hours. Maybe less.\nShoshana grins. “You look a little spooked there, mortal. Would you like an antidote? Of course I have an antidote with me. Human meat tastes terrible with Deathspore coursing through it. Here.”\nShe walks over to you and thrusts at your face a goblet of dark liquid. You sit up, noticing in that moment that your sword and armour are gone, and sniff the drink. It smells awful. Watching the witch carefully, you slowly bring the goblet to your lips and pretend to take a sip. The expression of unbridled, maniacal glee on her face tells you all you need to know. As she opens her lips to cackle, you quickly lean forward and throw the contents of the goblet right at her mouth. Right down her throat.\nInstead of cackling, Shoshana screams. It's a scream of death.\n“No!” she shrieks. “No! No one can kill the Jade Witch! I, who have devoured – devoured civilisation's greatest warriors... downed great empires... and destroyed... de-destroyed...”\nShe collapses. And then her body dissolves in a puff of grey smoke. All that remains are her hat, her crystal ball, and the now-empty goblet.\nYou'll receive a hero's welcome when you arrive at the palace with news of the fabled witch's death, but not if the Deathspores kill you before you can get there. It is true that no one knows poisons and antidotes better than a witch; if an antidote does exist, you're most likely to find it right here.<|end_of_turn|>"}

In the meantime, mix the flour, baking soda, and baking powder in a large bowl.\n\nWhisk together the yeast mixture, yogurt, and milk and stir into the dry ingredients. Knead with your hands until the dough forms a smooth, soft ball, about 2 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Leave at room temperature until doubled in size, about 2 hours.\n\nRemove the dough from the bowl and turn onto a well-floured surface. Knead it briefly and divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Roll it into 1/4-inch thick ovals, approximately 6 inches wide.\n\nHeat a cast-iron skillet over moderately high heat. Sprinkle each portion with minced garlic and press it into the dough. Brush the dough with melted butter and place in skillet. Cook for about one minute, until the dough puffs up. Flip, cover the pan, and cook for one more minute. Remove from the pan and brush both sides with butter and sprinkle with salt. Place in a towel-lined bowl until ready to serve.<|end_of_turn|>"}

{"prompt": "Next.js 13 Generating Static Params\nThe generateStaticParams server function can be used in combination with dynamic route segments to define the list of route segment parameters that will be statically generated at build time instead of on-demand.\n\nThis replaces getStaticPaths of Next.js 12 with a simplified API. generateStaticParams doesn't require any context parameters. It runs at build time before the corresponding Layouts or Pages are generated. It will not be called again during revalidation (ISR).\n\nThe primary benefit of the generateStaticParams function in it's smart retrieval of data. If content is fetched within the generateStaticParams function using a fetch request, the requests are automatically deduped. This means a fetch request with the same arguments across multiple generateStaticParams, Layouts, and Pages will only be made once, which decreases build times.\n\nGenerating Static Params\nThe generateStaticParams function can be used in combination with dynamic route segments to statically generate routes at build time instead of on-demand at request time.\n\ne.g. app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json());\n\n return posts.map((post) => ({\n slug: post.slug,\n }));\n}\n\nThe primary benefit of the generateStaticParams function is its smart retrieval of data. If content is fetched within the generateStaticParams function using a fetch request, the requests are automatically deduplicated. This means a fetch request with the same arguments across multiple generateStaticParams, Layouts, and Pages will only be made once, which decreases build times.\n\n----\n\nDynamic Segments\nWhen you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time and want to create routes from dynamic data, you can use Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time or prerendered at build time.\n\nConvention\nA Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a folder’s name in square brackets: [folderName]. For example, [id] or [slug].\n\nDynamic Segments are passed as the params prop to layout, page, route, and generateMetadata functions.\n\nExample\nFor example, a simple blog could include the following route app/blog/[slug]/page.js where [slug] is the Dynamic Segment for blog posts.\n\napp/blog/[slug]/page.js\nexport default function Page({ params }) {\n return My Post;\n}\n\nRoute Example URL params\napp/blog/[slug]/page.js /blog/a { slug: 'a' }\napp/blog/[slug]/page.js /blog/b { slug: 'b' }\napp/blog/[slug]/page.js /blog/c { slug: 'c' }\nSee the generateStaticParams() page to learn how to generate the params for the segment.\n\nSee the generateStaticParams() page to learn how to generate the params for the segment.\n\nNote: Dynamic Segments are equivalent to Dynamic Routes in the pages directory.\n\nCatch-all Segments\nDynamic Segments can be extended to catch-all subsequent segments by adding an ellipsis inside the brackets [...folderName].\n\nFor example, app/shop/[...slug]/page.js will match /shop/clothes, but also /shop/clothes/tops, /shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts, and so on.\n\nRoute Example URL params\napp/shop/[...slug]/page.js /shop/a { slug: ['a'] }\napp/shop/[...slug]/page.js /shop/a/b { slug: ['a', 'b'] }\napp/shop/[...slug]/page.js /shop/a/b/c { slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }\nOptional Catch-all Segments\nCatch-all Segments can be made optional by including the parameter in double square brackets: [[...folderName]].\n\nFor example, app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js will also match /shop, in addition to /shop/clothes, /shop/clothes/tops, /shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts.\n\nThe difference between catch-all and optional catch-all segments is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (/shop in the example above).\n\nRoute Example URL params\napp/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js /shop {}\napp/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js /shop/a { slug: ['a'] }\napp/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js /shop/a/b { slug: ['a', 'b'] }\napp/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js /shop/a/b/c { slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }\nTypeScript\nWhen using TypeScript, you can add types for params depending on your configured route segment.\n\napp/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\nexport default function Page({\n params,\n}: {\n params: { slug: string };\n}) {\n return My Page\n=======\n\n;\n}\nRoute params Type Definition\napp/blog/[slug]/page.js { slug: string }\napp/shop/[...slug]/page.js { slug: string[] }\napp/[categoryId]/[itemId]/page.js { categoryId: string, itemId: string }\n\n----\n\ngenerateStaticParams\nThe generateStaticParams function can be used in combination with dynamic route segments to statically generate routes at build time instead of on-demand at request time.\n\napp/blog/[slug]/page.js\n\n// Return a list of `params` to populate the [slug] dynamic segment\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json());\n\n return posts.map((post) => ({\n slug: post.slug,\n }));\n}\n\n// Multiple versions of this page will be statically generated\n// using the `params` returned by `generateStaticParams`\nexport default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n const { slug } = params;\n // ...\n}\n\nGood to know\n\nYou can use the dynamicParams segment config option to control what happens when a dynamic segment is visited that was not generated with generateStaticParams.\nDuring next dev, generateStaticParams will be called when you navigate to a route.\nDuring next build, generateStaticParams runs before the corresponding Layouts or Pages are generated.\nDuring revalidation (ISR), generateStaticParams will not be called again.\nAPI Reference\nParameters\noptions.params (optional)\n\nIf multiple dynamic segments in a route use generateStaticParams, the child generateStaticParams function is executed once for each set of params the parent generates.\n\nThe params object contains the populated params from the parent generateStaticParams, which can be used to generate the params in a child segment.\n\nReturns\ngenerateStaticParams should return an array of objects where each object represents the populated dynamic segments of a single route.\n\nEach property in the object is a dynamic segment to be filled in for the route.\nThe properties name is the segment's name, and the properties value is what that segment should be filled in with.\nExample Route generateStaticParams Return Type\n/product/[id] { id: string }[]\n/products/[category]/[product] { category: string, product: string }[]\n/products/[...slug] { slug: string[] }[]\nSingle Dynamic Segment\napp/product/[id].tsx\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n return [\n { id: '1' },\n { id: '2' },\n { id: '3' },\n ];\n}\n\n// Three versions of this page will be statically generated\n// using the `params` returned by `generateStaticParams`\n// -
